<h2>I</h2>
</div>

<p>Two young men in officers&#8217; uniforms entered the
smoker of a suburban train, and after the usual
formalities of matches and cigarettes settled back to
enjoy their ride out to Bryne Haven.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye think of that girl I introduced you
to the other night, Harry? Isn&#8217;t she a pippin?&#8221;
asked the second lieutenant taking a luxurious puff
at his cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say, Bobbie, she&#8217;s some girl! Where
d&#8217;ye pick her up? I certainly owe you one for a
good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it, Harry. Come on with me
and try it again. I&#8217;m going to see her friend to-night
and can get her over the &#8217;phone any time.
She&#8217;s just nuts about you. What do you say? Shall
I call her up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardly to-night, Bob,&#8221; said the first
lieutenant thoughtfully, &#8220;she&#8217;s a ripping fine girl
and all that, of course, but the fact is, Bob, I&#8217;ve decided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
to marry Ruth Macdonald and I haven&#8217;t
much time left before I go over. I think I&#8217;ll have
to get things fixed up between us to-night, you see.
Perhaps&mdash;later&mdash;&mdash;. But no. I guess that
wouldn&#8217;t do. Ruth&#8217;s folks are rather fussy about
such things. It might get out. No, Bob, I&#8217;ll have
to forego the pleasures you offer me this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second lieutenant sat up and whistled:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve decided to marry Ruth Macdonald!&#8221;
he ejaculated, staring. &#8220;But has Ruth Macdonald
decided to marry you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think there&#8217;ll be any trouble on that
score when I get ready to propose,&#8221; smiled the first
lieutenant complacently, as he lolled back in his
seat. &#8220;You seem surprised,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, rather!&#8221; said the other officer dryly,
still staring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s there so surprising about that?&#8221; The
first lieutenant was enjoying the sensation he was
creating. He knew that the second lieutenant had
always been &#8220;sweet&#8221; on Ruth Macdonald.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, Harry, you&#8217;re pretty rotten!&#8221;
said the second lieutenant uneasily, a flush
beginning to rise in his face. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
have the nerve. She&#8217;s a mighty fine girl, you know.
She&#8217;s&mdash;<i>unusual</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Didn&#8217;t you suppose I would want a
fine girl when I marry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re really going to do it!&#8221;
burst forth the second lieutenant. &#8220;In fact, I don&#8217;t
believe I&#8217;ll <i>let</i> you do it if you try!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t stop me, Bob!&#8221; with an amiable
sneer. &#8220;One word from you, young man, and I&#8217;d
put your captain wise about where you were the last
time you overstayed your leave and got away with
it. You know I&#8217;ve got a pull with your captain.
It never pays for the pot to call the kettle black.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second lieutenant sat back sullenly with a
deep red streaking his cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no angel yourself, Bob, see?&#8221; went on
the first lieutenant lying back in his seat in satisfied
triumph, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to marry Ruth Macdonald
next week and get a ten days&#8217; leave! Put that in
your pipe and smoke it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There ensued a long and pregnant silence. One
glance at the second lieutenant showed that he was
most effectually silenced.
</p>
<p>The front door of the car slammed open and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
shut, and a tall slim officer with touches of silver
about the edges of his dark hair, and a look of command
in his keen eyes came crisply down the aisle.
The two young lieutenants sat up with a jerk, and
an undertone of oaths, and prepared to salute as he
passed them. The captain gave them a quick
searching glance as he saluted and went on to the
next car.
</p>
<p>The two jerked out salutes and settled back
uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man gives me a pain!&#8221; said Harry
Wainwright preparing to soothe his ruffled spirits
by a fresh cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks he&#8217;s so doggone good himself that
he has to pry into other people&#8217;s business and get
them in wrong. It beats me how he ever got to be a
captain&mdash;a prim old fossil like him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might puzzle some people to know how you
got your commission, Harry. You&#8217;re no fossil, of
course, but you&#8217;re no angel, either, and there are
some things in your career that aren&#8217;t exactly laid
down in military manuals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my uncle Henry looked after my commission.
It was a cinch! He thinks the sun rises and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
sets in me, and he had no idea how he perjured himself
when he put me through. Why, I&#8217;ve got some
of the biggest men in the country for my backers,
and wouldn&#8217;t they lie awake at night if they knew!
Oh Boy! I thought I&#8217;d croak when I read some
of those recommendations, they fairly gushed with
praise. You&#8217;d have died laughing, Bob, if you had
read them. They had such adjectives as &#8216;estimable,
moral, active, efficient,&#8217; and one went so far as
to say that I was equally distinguished in college in
scholarship and athletics! Some stretch of imagination,
eh, what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two laughed loudly over this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the best of it is,&#8221; continued the first lieutenant,
&#8220;the poor boob believed it was all true!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your college records, Harry, how could
they get around those? Or didn&#8217;t they look
you up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother fixed that all up. She sent the
college a good fat check to establish a new scholarship
or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky dog!&#8221; sighed his friend. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m
just the other way. I never try to put anything over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
but I get caught, and nobody ever tried to cover up
my tracks for me when I got gay!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You worry too much, Bobby, and you never
take a chance. Now <i>I</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The front door of the car opened and shut with
a slam, and a tall young fellow with a finely cut face
and wearing workman&#8217;s clothes entered. He gave
one quick glance down the car as though he was
searching for someone, and came on down the aisle.
The sight of him stopped the boast on young Wainwright&#8217;s
tongue, and an angry flush grew, and
rolled up from the top of his immaculate olive-drab
collar to his close, military hair-cut.
</p>
<p>Slowly, deliberately, John Cameron walked
down the aisle of the car looking keenly from side
to side, scanning each face alertly, until his eyes
lighted on the two young officers. At Bob Wetherill
he merely glanced knowingly, but he fixed his
eyes on young Wainwright with a steady, amused,
contemptuous gaze as he came toward him; a gaze
so noticeable that it could not fail to arrest the attention
of any who were looking; and he finished the
affront with a lingering turn of his head as he passed
by, and a slight accentuation of the amusement as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
he finally lifted his gaze and passed on out of the
rear door of the car. Those who were sitting in the
seats near the door might have heard the words:
&#8220;And they <i>killed</i> such men as Lincoln!&#8221; muttered
laughingly as the door slammed shut behind him.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Wainwright uttered a low oath of
imprecation and flung his half spent cigarette on
the floor angrily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that, Bob?&#8221; he complained furiously,
&#8220;If I don&#8217;t get that fellow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did! Are you going to stand for
that? What&#8217;s eating him, anyway? Has he got it
in for you again? But <i>he</i> isn&#8217;t a very easy fellow
to get, you know. He has the reputation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know! Yes, I guess anyhow <i>I
know</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see! Licked you, too, once, did he?&#8221;
laughed Wetherill, &#8220;what had you been up to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, having some fun with his girl! At least
I suppose she must have been his girl the way he
carried on about it. He said he didn&#8217;t know her,
but of course that was all bluff. Then, too, I called
his father a name he didn&#8217;t like and he lit into me
again. Good night! I thought that was the end
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
of little Harry! I was sick for a week after he got
through with me. He certainly is some brute. Of
course, I didn&#8217;t realize what I was up against at
first or I&#8217;d have got the upper hand right away. I
could have, you know! I&#8217;ve been trained! But I
didn&#8217;t want to hurt the fellow and get into the
papers. You see, the circumstances were peculiar
just then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see! You&#8217;d just applied for Officer&#8217;s Training
Camp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, and you know you never can tell
what rumor a person like that can start. He&#8217;s keen
enough to see the advantage, of course, and follow
it up. Oh, he&#8217;s got one coming to him all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s keen all right. That&#8217;s the trouble.
It&#8217;s hard to get him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just wait. I&#8217;ve got him now. If I
don&#8217;t make him bite the dust! Ye gods! When I
think of the way he looks at me every time he sees
me I could skin him alive!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy he&#8217;d be rather slippery to skin. I
wouldn&#8217;t like to try it, Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but wait till you see where I&#8217;ve got him!
He&#8217;s in the draft. He goes next week. And they&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
sending all those men to our camp! He&#8217;ll be a
private, of course, and he&#8217;ll have to <i>salute me</i>!
Won&#8217;t that gall him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t do it! I know him, and <i>he won&#8217;t
do it</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care that he does it all right! I&#8217;ll
put myself in his way and <i>make</i> him do it. And if
he refuses I&#8217;ll report him and get him in the guard
house. See? I can, you know. Then I guess he&#8217;ll
smile out of the other side of his mouth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t likely be in your company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make any difference. I can get
him into trouble if he isn&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ll try to work it
that he is if I can. I&#8217;ve got &#8216;pull,&#8217; you know, and
I know how to &#8216;work&#8217; my superiors!&#8221; he swaggered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t very good policy,&#8221; advised the other,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of men picking off officers they didn&#8217;t
like when it came to battle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take good care that he&#8217;s in front of me on
all such occasions!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden nudge from his companion made him
look up, and there looking sharply down at him,
was the returning captain, and behind him walked
John Cameron still with that amused smile on his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
face. It was plain that they had both heard his
boast. His face crimsoned and he jerked out a
tardy salute, as the two passed on leaving him muttering
imprecations under his breath.
</p>
<p>When the front door slammed behind the two
Wainwright spoke in a low shaken growl:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what in thunder is that Captain La Rue
going on to Bryne Haven for? I thought, of course,
he got off at Spring Heights. That&#8217;s where his
mother lives. I&#8217;ll bet he is going up to see Ruth
Macdonald! You know they&#8217;re related. If he is,
that knocks my plans all into a cocked hat. I&#8217;d
have to sit at attention all the evening, and I couldn&#8217;t
propose with that cad around!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put it off then and come with me,&#8221;
soothed his friend. &#8220;Athalie Britt will help you
forget your troubles all right, and there&#8217;s plenty of
time. You&#8217;ll get another leave soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How the dickens did John Cameron come to
be on speaking terms with Captain La Rue, I&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221; mused Wainwright, paying no heed
to his friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! That does complicate matters for you
some, doesn&#8217;t it? Captain La Rue is down at your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
camp, isn&#8217;t he? Why, I suppose Cameron knew
him up at college, perhaps. Cap used to come up
from the university every week last winter to lecture
at college.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wainwright muttered a chain of choice expletives
known only to men of his kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it!&#8221; encouraged his friend slapping
him vigorously on the shoulder as the train drew
into Bryne Haven. &#8220;Come off that grouch and
get busy! You&#8217;re on leave, man! If you can&#8217;t visit
one woman there&#8217;s plenty more, and time enough
to get married, too, before you go to France. Marriage
is only an incident, anyway. Why make such
a fuss about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the fitful glare of the station lights they
could see that Cameron was walking with the captain
just ahead of them in the attitude of familiar
converse. The sight did not put Wainwright into
a better humor.
</p>
<p>At the great gate of the Macdonald estate Cameron
and La Rue parted. They could hear the
last words of their conversation as La Rue swung
into the wide driveway and Cameron started on up
the street:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to it the first thing in the morning,
Cameron, and I&#8217;m glad you spoke to me about it!
I don&#8217;t see any reason why it shouldn&#8217;t go through!
I shall be personally gratified if we can make the
arrangement. Good-night and good luck to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two young officers halted at a discreet distance
until John Cameron had turned off to the
right and walked away into the darkness. The captain&#8217;s
quick step could be heard crunching along
the gravel drive to the Macdonald house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess that about settles me for the
night, Bobbie!&#8221; sighed Wainwright. &#8220;Come on,
let&#8217;s pass the time away somehow. I&#8217;ll stop at the
drug store to &#8217;phone and make a date with Ruth for
to-morrow morning. Wonder where I can get a
car to take her out? No, I don&#8217;t want to go in her
car because she always wants to run it herself.
When you&#8217;re proposing to a woman you don&#8217;t want
her to be absorbed in running a car. See?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t so much experience
in that line as you have, Harry, but I should think
it might be inconvenient,&#8221; laughed the other.
</p>
<p>They went back to the station. A few minutes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
later Wainwright emerged from the telephone booth
in the drug store with a lugubrious expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doggone my luck! She&#8217;s promised to go to
church with that smug cousin of hers, and she&#8217;s busy
all the rest of the day. But she&#8217;s promised to give
me next Saturday if I can get off!&#8221; His face
brightened with the thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I can make it. If I can&#8217;t do anything
else I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em I&#8217;m going to be married, and then
I can make her rush things through, perhaps. Girls
are game for that sort of thing just now; it&#8217;s in the
air, these war marriages. By George, I&#8217;m not sure
but that&#8217;s the best way to work it after all. She&#8217;s
the kind of a girl that would do almost anything to
help you out of a fix that way, and I&#8217;ll just tell her
I had to say that to get off and that I&#8217;ll be court-martialed
if they find out it wasn&#8217;t so. How
about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Harry. It&#8217;s all right, of course,
if you can get away with it, but Ruth&#8217;s a pretty
bright girl and has a will of her own, you know.
But now, come on. It&#8217;s getting late. What do you
say if we get up a party and run down to Atlantic
City over Sunday, now that you&#8217;re free? I know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
those two girls would be tickled to death to go,
especially Athalie. She&#8217;s a Westerner, you know,
and has never seen the ocean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, come on, only you must promise
there won&#8217;t be any scrapes that will get me into
the papers and blow back to Bryne Haven. You
know there&#8217;s a lot of Bryne Haven people go to
Atlantic City this time of year and I&#8217;m not going to
have any stories started. <i>I&#8217;m going to marry Ruth
Macdonald!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Come on.&#8221;

<h2>II</h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth Macdonald drew up her little electric
runabout sharply at the crossing, as the station
gates suddenly clanged down in her way, and sat
back with a look of annoyance on her face.
</p>
<p>Michael of the crossing was so overcareful sometimes
that it became trying. She was sure there
was plenty of time to cross before the down train.
She glanced at her tiny wrist watch and frowned.
Why, it was fully five minutes before the train was
due! What could Michael mean, standing there
with his flag so importantly and that determined
look upon his face?
</p>
<p>She glanced down the platform and was surprised
to find a crowd. There must be a special
expected. What was it? A convention of some
sort? Or a picnic? It was late in the season for
picnics, and not quite soon enough for a college football
game. Who were they, anyway? She looked
them over and was astonished to find people of
every class, the workers, the wealthy, the plain
every-day men, women and children, all with a waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
attitude and a strange seriousness upon them.
As she looked closer she saw tears on some faces and
handkerchiefs everywhere in evidence. Had some
one died? Was this a funeral train they were awaiting?
Strange she had not heard!
</p>
<p>Then the band suddenly burst out upon her
with the familiar wail:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>There&#8217;s a long, long trail awinding,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Into the land of our dreams,&mdash;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and behind came the muffled tramping of feet not
accustomed to marching together.
</p>
<p>Ruth suddenly sat up very straight and began
to watch, an unfamiliar awe upon her. This must
be the first draft men just going away! Of course!
Why had she not thought of it at once. She had
read about their going and heard people mention it
the last week, but it had not entered much into her
thoughts. She had not realized that it would be a
ceremony of public interest like this. She had no
friends whom it would touch. The young men of
her circle had all taken warning in plenty of time
and found themselves a commission somewhere, two
of them having settled up matters but a few days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
before. She had thought of these draft men, when
she had thought of them at all, only when she saw
mention of them in the newspapers, and then as a
lot of workingmen or farmers&#8217; boys who were reluctant
to leave their homes and had to be forced into
patriotism in this way. It had not occurred to her
that there were many honorable young men who
would take this way of putting themselves at the
disposal of their country in her time of need, without
attempting to feather a nice little nest for themselves.
Now she watched them seriously and found
to her astonishment that she knew many of them.
There were three college fellows in the front ranks
whom she had met. She had danced with them and
been taken out to supper by them, and had a calling
acquaintance with their sisters. The sister of one
stood on the sidewalk now in the common crowd,
quite near to the runabout, and seemed to have forgotten
that anybody was by. Her face was
drenched with tears and her lips were quivering.
Behind her was a gray-haired woman with a skewey
blouse and a faded dark blue serge skirt too long
for the prevailing fashion. The tears were trickling
down her cheeks also; and an old man with a crutch,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and a little round-eyed girl, seemed to belong to
the party. The old man&#8217;s lips were set and he was
looking at the boys with his heart in his eyes.
</p>
<p>Ruth shrank back not to intrude upon such open
sorrow, and glanced at the line again as they
straggled down the road to the platform; fifty serious,
grave-eyed young men with determined mien
and sorrow in the very droop of their shoulders.
One could see how they hated all this publicity and
display, this tense moment of farewell in the eyes of
the town; and yet how tender they felt toward those
dear ones who had gathered thus to do them honor
as they went away to do their part in the great
world-struggle for liberty.
</p>
<p>As she looked closer the girl saw they were not
mature men as at first glance they had seemed, but
most of them mere boys. There was the boy that
mowed the Macdonald lawn, and the yellow-haired
grocery boy. There was the gas man and the nice
young plumber who fixed the leak in the water
pipes the other day, and the clerk from the post
office, and the cashier from the bank! What made
them look so old at first sight? Why, it was as if
sorrow and responsibility had suddenly been put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
upon them like a garment that morning for a uniform,
and they walked in the shadow of the great
sadness that had come upon the world. She understood
that perhaps even up to the very day before,
they had most of them been merry, careless boys;
but now they were men, made so in a night by the
horrible <i>sin</i> that had brought about this thing
called War.
</p>
<p>For the first time since the war began Ruth
Macdonald had a vision of what the war meant.
She had been knitting, of course, with all the rest;
she had spent long mornings at the Red Cross
rooms&mdash;she was on her way there this very minute
when Michael and the procession had interrupted
her course&mdash;she had made miles of surgical dressings
and picked tons of oakum. She had bade her
men friends cheery good-byes when they went to
Officers&#8217; Training Camps, and with the other girls
welcomed and admired their uniforms when they
came home on short furloughs, one by one winning
his stripes and commission. They were all men
whom she had known in society. They had wealth
and position and found it easy to get into the kind
of thing that pleased them in the army or navy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
The danger they were facing seemed hardly a negligible
quantity. It was the fashion to look on it
that way. Ruth had never thought about it before.
She had even been severe in her judgment of a few
mothers who worried about their sons and wanted
to get them exempt in some way. But these stern
loyal mothers who stood in close ranks with heavy
lines of sacrifice upon their faces, tears on their
cheeks, love and self-abnegation in their eyes, gave
her a new view of the world. These were the ones
who would be in actual poverty, some of them, without
their boys, and whose lives would be empty
indeed when they went forth. Ruth Macdonald
had never before realized the suffering this war was
causing individuals until she saw the faces of those
women with their sons and brothers and lovers; until
she saw the faces of the brave boys, for the moment
all the rollicking lightness gone, and only the pain
of parting and the mists of the unknown future in
their eyes.
</p>
<p>It came to the girl with a sudden pang that she
was left out of all this. That really it made little
difference to her whether America was in the war or
not. Her life would go on just the same&mdash;a pleasant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
monotony of bustle and amusement. There would
be the same round of social affairs and regular engagements,
spiced with the excitement of war work
and occasional visiting uniforms. There was no
one going forth from their home to fight whose
going would put the light of life out for her and
cause her to feel sad, beyond the ordinary superficial
sadness for the absence of one&#8217;s playmates.
</p>
<p>She liked them all, her friends, and shrank from
having them in danger; although it was splendid to
have them doing something real at last. In truth
until this moment the danger had seemed so remote;
the casualty list of which people spoke with bated
breath so much a thing of vast unknown numbers,
that it had scarcely come within her realization as
yet. But now she suddenly read the truth in the
suffering eyes of these people who were met to say
good-bye, perhaps a last good-bye, to those who
were dearer than life to them. How would she,
Ruth Macdonald, feel, if one of those boys were
her brother or lover? It was inconceivably dreadful.
</p>
<p>The band blared on, and the familiar words insisted
themselves upon her unwilling mind:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>There&#8217;s a long, long night of waiting!</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>A sob at her right made her start and then turn
away quickly from the sight of a mother&#8217;s grief as
she clung to a frail daughter for support, sobbing
with utter abandon, while the daughter kept begging
her to &#8220;be calm for Tom&#8217;s sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was all horrible! Why had she gotten into
this situation? Aunt Rhoda would blame her for
it. Aunt Rhoda would say it was too conspicuous,
right there in the front ranks! She put her hand
on the starter and glanced out, hoping to be able to
back out and get away, but the road behind was
blocked several deep with cars, and the crowd had
closed in upon her and about her on every side.
Retreat was impossible. However, she noticed with
relief that the matter of being conspicuous need not
trouble her. Nobody was looking her way. All
eyes were turned in one direction, toward that straggling,
determined line that wound up from the
Borough Hall, past the Post Office and Bank to
the station where the Home Guards stood uniformed,
in open silent ranks doing honor to the boys
who were going to fight for them.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s eyes went reluctantly back to the marching
line again. Somehow it struck her that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
would not have seemed so forlorn if they had worn
new trig uniforms, instead of rusty varied civilian
clothes. They seemed like an ill-prepared sacrifice
passing in review. Then suddenly her gaze was
riveted upon a single figure, the last man in the
procession, marching alone, with uplifted head and
a look of self-abnegation on his strong young face.
All at once something sharp seemed to slash through
her soul and hold her with a long quiver of pain and
she sat looking straight ahead staring with a kind
of wild frenzy at John Cameron walking alone at
the end of the line.
</p>
<p>She remembered him in her youngest school
days, the imp of the grammar school, with a twinkle
in his eye and an irrepressible grin on his handsome
face. Nothing had ever daunted him and no punishment
had ever stopped his mischief. He never
studied his lessons, yet he always seemed to know
enough to carry him through, and would sometimes
burst out with astonishing knowledge where others
failed. But there was always that joke on his lips
and that wide delightful grin that made him the
worshipped-afar of all the little girls. He had
dropped a rose on her desk once as he lounged late
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
and laughing to his seat after recess, apparently
unaware that his teacher was calling him to order.
She could feel the thrill of her little childish heart
now as she realized that he had given the rose to
her. The next term she was sent to a private school
and saw no more of him save an occasional glimpse
in passing him on the street, but she never had forgotten
him; and now and then she had heard little
scraps of news about him. He was working his
way through college. He was on the football team
and the baseball team. She knew vaguely that his
father had died and their money was gone, but beyond
that she had no knowledge of him. They had
drifted apart. He was not of her world, and gossip
about him seldom came her way. He had long ago
ceased to look at her when they happened to pass on
the street. He doubtless had forgotten her, or
thought she had forgotten him. Or, it might even
be that he did not wish to presume upon an acquaintance
begun when she was too young to have a choice
of whom should be her friends. But the memory of
that rose had never quite faded from her heart even
though she had been but seven, and always she had
looked after him when she chanced to see him on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
street with a kind of admiration and wonder. Now
suddenly she saw him in another light. The laugh
was gone from his lips and the twinkle from his
eyes. He looked as he had looked the day he fought
Chuck Woodcock for tying a string across the sidewalk
and tripping up the little girls on the way to
school. It came to her like a revelation that he was
going forth now in just such a way to fight the
world-foe. In a way he was going to fight for her.
To make the world a safe place for girls such as
she! All the terrible stories of Belgium flashed
across her mind, and she was lifted on a great wave
of gratitude to this boy friend of her babyhood for
going out to defend her!
</p>
<p>All the rest of the straggling line of draft men
were going out for the same purpose perhaps, but
it did not occur to her that they were anything to
her until she saw John Cameron. All those friends
of her own world who were training for officers,
they, too, were going to fight in the same way to
defend the world, but she had not thought of it in
that way before. It took a sight of John Cameron&#8217;s
high bearing and serious face to bring the knowledge
to her mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>She thought no longer of trying to get away.
She seemed held to the spot by a new insight into
life. She could not take her eyes from the face of
the young man. She forgot that she was staying,
forgot that she was staring. She could no more
control the swelling thoughts of horror that surged
over her and took possession of her than she could
have controlled a mob if it had suddenly swept
down upon her.
</p>
<p>The gates presently lifted silently to let the
little procession pass over to her side of the tracks,
and within a few short minutes the special train that
was to bear the men away to camp came rattling up,
laden with other victims of the chance that sent
some men on ahead to be pioneers in the camps.
</p>
<p>These were a noisy jolly bunch. Perhaps, having
had their own sad partings they were only trying
to brace themselves against the scenes of other
partings through which they must pass all the way
along the line. They must be reminded of their
own mothers and sisters and sweethearts. Something
of this Ruth Macdonald seemed to define to
herself as, startled and annoyed by the clamor of
the strangers in the midst of the sacredness of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
moment, she turned to look at the crowding heads
in the car windows and caught the eye of an irrepressible
youth:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of me over there!&#8221; he shouted, waving
a flippant hand and twinkling his eyes at the beautiful
girl in her car.
</p>
<p>Another time Ruth would have resented such
familiarity, but now something touched her spirit
with an inexpressible pity, and she let a tiny ripple
of a smile pass over her lovely face as her eyes
traveled on down the platform in search of the tall
form of John Cameron. In the moment of the
oncoming train she had somehow lost sight of him.
Ah! There he was stooping over a little white
haired woman, taking her tenderly in his arms to
kiss her. The girl&#8217;s eyes lingered on him. His
whole attitude was such a revelation of the man the
rollicking boy had become. It seemed to pleasantly
round out her thought of him.
</p>
<p>The whistle sounded, the drafted men gave one
last wringing hand-clasp, one last look, and sprang
on board.
</p>
<p>John Cameron was the last to board the train.
He stood on the lower step of the last car as it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
began to move slowly. His hat was lifted, and he
stood with slightly lifted chin and eyes that looked
as if they had sounded the depths of all sadness and
surrendered himself to whatever had been decreed.
There was settled sorrow in all the lines of his fine
face. Ruth was startled by the change in it; by the
look of the boy in the man. Had the war done that
for him just in one short summer? Had it done
that for the thousands who were going to fight for
her? And she was sitting in her luxurious car with
a bundle of wool at her feet, and presuming to bear
her part by mere knitting! Poor little useless
woman that she was! A thing to send a man forth
from everything he counted dear or wanted to do,
into suffering and hardship&mdash;and <i>death</i>&mdash;perhaps!
She shuddered as she watched his face with
its strong uplifted look, and its unutterable sorrow.
She had not thought he could look like that! Oh,
he would be gay to-morrow, like the rest, of course,
with his merry jest and his contagious grin, and
making light of the serious business of war! He
would not be the boy he used to be without the
ability to do that. But she would never forget how
he had looked in this farewell minute while he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
gazing his last on the life of his boyhood and being
borne away into a dubious future. She felt a hopelessly
yearning, as if, had there been time, she would
have liked to have told him how much she appreciated
his doing this great deed for her and for all
her sisters!
</p>
<p>Has it ever been fully explained why the eyes of
one person looking hard across a crowd will draw
the eyes of another?
</p>
<p>The train had slipped along ten feet or more
and was gaining speed when John Cameron&#8217;s eyes
met those of Ruth Macdonald, and her vivid speaking
face flashed its message to his soul. A pleased
wonder sprang into his eyes, a question as his glance
lingered, held by the tumult in her face, and the unmistakable
personality of her glance. Then his face
lit up with its old smile, graver, oh, much! and more
deferential than it used to be, with a certain courtliness
in it that spoke of maturity of spirit. He
lifted his hat a little higher and waved it just a trifle
in recognition of her greeting, wondering in sudden
confusion if he were really not mistaken after
all and had perhaps been appropriating a farewell
that belonged to someone else; then amazed and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
pleased at the flutter of her handkerchief in reply.
</p>
<p>The train was moving rapidly now in the midst
of a deep throaty cheer that sounded more like a
sob, and still he stood on that bottom step with his
hat lifted and let his eyes linger on the slender
girlish figure in the car, with the morning sun glinting
across her red-gold hair, and the beautiful soft
rose color in her cheeks.
</p>
<p>As the train swept past the little shelter shed he
bethought himself and turned a farewell tender
smile on the white-haired woman who stood watching
him through a mist of tears. Then his eyes
went back for one last glimpse of the girl; and so
he flashed out of sight around the curve.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
<h2>III</h2>
</div>

<p>It had taken only a short time after all. The
crowd drowned its cheer in one deep gasp of silence
and broke up tearfully into little groups beginning
to melt away at the sound of Michael ringing up the
gates, and telling the cars and wagons to hurry that
it was almost time for the up-train.
</p>
<p>Ruth Macdonald started her car and tried to
bring her senses back to their normal calm wondering
what had happened to her and why there was
such an inexpressible mingling of loss and pleasure
in her heart.
</p>
<p>The way at first was intricate with congestion
of traffic and Ruth was obliged to go slowly. As
the road cleared before her she was about to glide
forward and make up for lost time. Suddenly a
bewildered little woman with white hair darted in
front of the car, hesitated, drew back, came on
again. Ruth stopped the car shortly, much shaken
with the swift vision of catastrophe, and the sudden
recognition of the woman. It was the same
one who had been with John Cameron.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry I startled you!&#8221; she called
pleasantly, leaning out of the car. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you get
in, please, and let me take you home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman looked up and there were great
tears in her eyes. It was plain why she had not
seen where she was going.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, no, I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; she said with a
choke in her voice and another blur of tears, &#8220;I&mdash;you
see&mdash;I want to get away&mdash;I&#8217;ve been seeing off
my boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221; said Ruth with quick sympathy, &#8220;I
saw. And you want to get home quickly and cry.
I feel that way myself. But you see I didn&#8217;t have
anybody there and I&#8217;d like to do a little something
just to be in it. Won&#8217;t you please get in? You&#8217;ll
get home sooner if I take you; and see! We&#8217;re
blocking the way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman cast a frightened glance about
and assented:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I didn&#8217;t realize!&#8221; she said climbing
awkwardly in and sitting bolt upright as uncomfortable
as could be in the luxurious car beside
the girl. It was all too plain she did not wish to
be there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Ruth man&oelig;uvred her car quickly out of the
crowd and into a side street, gliding from there to
the avenue. She did not speak until they had left
the melting crowd well behind them. Then she
turned timidly to the woman:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;are&mdash;his&mdash;<i>mother</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke the words hesitatingly as if she feared
to touch a wound. The woman&#8217;s eyes suddenly
filled again and a curious little quiver came on the
strong chin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she tried to say and smothered the word
in her handkerchief pressed quickly to her lips in an
effort to control them.
</p>
<p>Ruth laid a cool little touch on the woman&#8217;s other
hand that lay in her lap:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please forgive me!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure.
I know it must be awful,&mdash;cruel&mdash;for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;is all I have left!&#8221; the woman breathed
with a quick controlled gasp, &#8220;but, of course&mdash;it
was&mdash;right that he should go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She set her lips more firmly and blinked off at
the blur of pretty homes on her right without seeing
any of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have gone sooner, only he thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
he ought not to leave me till he had to,&#8221; she said
with another proud little quiver in her voice, as if
having once spoken she must go on and say more,
&#8220;I kept telling him I would get on all right&mdash;but
he always was so careful of me&mdash;ever since his
father died!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; said Ruth tenderly turning her
face away to struggle with a strange smarting sensation
in her own eyes and throat. Then in a low
voice she added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew him, you know. I used to go to the
same school with him when I was a little bit of
a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman looked up with a quick searching
glance and brushed the tears away firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, aren&#8217;t you Ruth Macdonald? <i>Miss</i>
Macdonald, I mean&mdash;excuse me! You live in the
big house on the hill, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m Ruth Macdonald. Please don&#8217;t call
me Miss. I&#8217;m only nineteen and I still answer to
my little girl name,&#8221; Ruth answered with a charming
smile.
</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s gaze softened.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know John knew you,&#8221; she said speculatively.
&#8220;He never mentioned&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; said the girl anticipating,
&#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t. It was a long time ago when I was
seven and I doubt if he remembers me any more.
They took me out of the public school the next
year and sent me to St. Mary&#8217;s for which I&#8217;ve never
quite forgiven them, for I&#8217;m sure I should have got
on much faster at the public school and I loved it.
But I&#8217;ve not forgotten the good times I had there,
and John was always good to the little girls. We
all liked him. I haven&#8217;t seen him much lately, but
I should think he would have grown to be just what
you say he is. He looks that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the woman&#8217;s eyes searched her face, as if
she questioned the sincerity of her words; then apparently
satisfied she turned away with a sigh:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have liked him to know a girl like you,&#8221;
she said wistfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Ruth brightly, &#8220;that sounds
like a real compliment. Perhaps we shall know each
other yet some day if fortune favors us. I&#8217;m quite
sure he&#8217;s worth knowing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he is!&#8221; said the little mother, her tears
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
brimming over again and flowing down her dismayed
cheeks, &#8220;he&#8217;s quite worth the best society
there is, but I haven&#8217;t been able to manage a lot of
things for him. It hasn&#8217;t been always easy to get
along since his father died. Something happened
to our money. But anyway, he got through college!&#8221;
with a flash of triumph in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that fine!&#8221; said Ruth with sparkling
eyes, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s worth a lot more than some
of the fellows who have always had every whim
gratified. Now, which street? You&#8217;ll have to tell
me. I&#8217;m ashamed to say I don&#8217;t know this part of
town very well. Isn&#8217;t it pretty down here? This
house? What a wonderful clematis! I never saw
such a wealth of bloom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, John planted that and fussed over it,&#8221;
said his mother with pride as she slipped unaccustomedly
out of the car to the sidewalk. &#8220;I&#8217;m very
glad to have met you and it was most kind of you to
bring me home. To tell the truth&#8221;&mdash;with a roguish
smile that reminded Ruth of her son&#8217;s grin&mdash;&#8220;I
was so weak and trembling with saying good-bye
and trying to keep up so John wouldn&#8217;t know it,
that I didn&#8217;t know how I was to get home. Though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
I&#8217;m afraid I was a bit discourteous. I couldn&#8217;t bear
the thought of talking to a stranger just then. But
you haven&#8217;t been like a stranger&mdash;knowing him,
and all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;it&#8217;s been so pleasant.
Do you know, I don&#8217;t believe I ever realized
what an awful thing the war is till I saw those
people down at the station this morning saying
good-bye. I never realized either what a useless
thing I am. I haven&#8217;t even anybody very dear to
send. I can only knit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a good deal. Some of us haven&#8217;t
time to do that. I never have a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to, you&#8217;ve given your son,&#8221;
said Ruth flashing a glance of glorified understanding
at the woman.
</p>
<p>A beautiful smile came out on the tired sorrowful
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve given him,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m hoping
God will give him back again some day. Do
you think that&#8217;s too much to hope. He is such a
good boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Ruth sharply with a sudden
sting of apprehension in her soul. And then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
she remembered that she had no very intimate
acquaintance with God. She wished she might be
on speaking terms, at least, and she would go and
present a plea for this lonely woman. If it were
only Captain La Rue, her favorite cousin, or even
the President, she might consider it. But God!
She shuddered. Didn&#8217;t God let this awful war be?
Why did He do it? She had never thought much
about God before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would let me come to see you
sometime and take you for another ride,&#8221; she
said sweetly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be beautiful!&#8221; said the older woman,
&#8220;if you would care to take the time from your
own friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to have you for one of my
friends,&#8221; said the girl gracefully.
</p>
<p>The woman smiled wistfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only here holidays and evenings,&#8221; she
conceded, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing some government work now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall come,&#8221; said Ruth brightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve enjoyed
you ever so much.&#8221; Then she started her car
and whirled away into the sunshine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t come, of course,&#8221; said the woman to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
herself as she stood looking mournfully after the
car, reluctant to go into the empty house. &#8220;I wish
she would! Isn&#8217;t she just like a flower! How wonderful
it would be if things had been different, and
there hadn&#8217;t been any war, and my boy could have
had her for a friend! Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Down at the Club House the women waited for
the fair young member who had charge of the wool.
They rallied her joyously as she hurried in, suddenly
aware that she had kept them all waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw her in the crowd at the station this morning,&#8221;
called out Mrs. Pryor, a large placid tease
with a twinkle in her eye. &#8220;She was picking out
the handsomest man for the next sweater she knits.
Which one did you choose, Miss Ruth? Tell us.
Are you going to write him a letter and stick it in
the toe of his sock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The annoyed color swept into Ruth&#8217;s face, but
she paid no other heed as she went about her morning
duties, preparing the wool to give out. A
thought had stolen into her heart that made a tumult
there and would not bear turning over even in her
mind in the presence of all these curious people.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
She put it resolutely by as she taught newcomers
how to turn the heel of a sock, but now and then it
crept back again and was the cause of her dropping
an occasional stitch.
</p>
<p>Dottie Wetherill came to find out what was the
matter with her sock, and to giggle and gurgle about
her brother Bob and his friends. Bob, it appeared,
was going to bring five officers home with him next
week end and they were to have a dance Saturday
night. Of course Ruth must come. Bob was soon
to get his <i>first</i> lieutenant&#8217;s commission. There had
been a mistake, of course, or he would have had it
before this, some favoritism shown; but now Bob
had what they called a &#8220;pull,&#8221; and things were
going to be all right for him. Bob said you couldn&#8217;t
get anywhere without a &#8220;pull.&#8221; And didn&#8217;t Ruth
think Bob looked perfectly fine in his uniform?
</p>
<p>It annoyed Ruth to hear such talk and she tried
to make it plain to Dottie that she was mistaken
about &#8220;pull.&#8221; There was no such thing. It was
all imagination. She knew, for her cousin, Captain
La Rue, was very close to the Government and he
had told her so. He said that real worth was always
recognized, and that it didn&#8217;t make any difference
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
where it was found or who your friends were. It
mattered <i>what you were</i>.
</p>
<p>She fixed Dottie&#8217;s sock and moved on to the wool
table to get ready an allotment for some of the
ladies to take home.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Wainwright bustled in, large and florid
and well groomed, with a bunch of photographer&#8217;s
proofs of her son Harry in his uniform. She
called loudly for Ruth to come and inspect them.
There were some twenty or more poses, each one
seemingly fatter, more pompous and conceited looking
than the last. She stated in boisterous good
humor that Harry particularly wanted Ruth&#8217;s
opinion before he gave the order. At that Mrs.
Pryor bent her head to her neighbor and nodded
meaningly, as if a certain matter of discussion
were settled now beyond all question. Ruth caught
the look and its meaning and the color flooded her
face once more, much to her annoyance. She wondered
angrily if she would never be able to stop
that childish habit of blushing, and why it annoyed
her so very much this morning to have her name
coupled with that of Harry Wainwright. He was
her old friend and playmate, having lived next door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
to her all her life, and it was but natural when
everybody was sweethearting and getting married,
that people should speak of her and wonder whether
there might be anything more to their relationship
than mere friendship. Still it annoyed her. Continually
as she turned the pages from one fat smug
Wainwright countenance to another, she saw in a
mist the face of another man, with uplifted head
and sorrowful eyes. She wondered if when the time
came for Harry Wainwright to go he would have
aught of the vision, and aught of the holiness of
sorrow that had shown in that other face.
</p>
<p>She handed the proofs back to the mother, so
like her son in her ample blandness, and wondered
if Mrs. Cameron would have a picture of her
son in his uniform, fine and large and lifelike as
these were.
</p>
<p>She interrupted her thoughts to hear Mrs.
Wainwright&#8217;s clarion voice lifted in parting from
the door of the Club House on her way back to
her car:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, Ruth dear. Don&#8217;t hesitate
to let me know if you&#8217;d like to have either of the
other two large ones for your own &#8216;specials,&#8217; you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
know. I shan&#8217;t mind changing the order a bit.
Harry said you were to have as many as you wanted.
I&#8217;ll hold the proofs for a day or two and let you
think it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth lifted her eyes to see the gaze of every
woman in the room upon her, and for a moment she
felt as if she almost hated poor fat doting Mamma
Wainwright. Then the humorous side of the moment
came to help her and her face blossomed into a
smile as she jauntily replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, please don&#8217;t bother, Mrs. Wainwright.
I&#8217;m not going to paper the wall with them. I have
other friends, you know. I think your choice was
the best of them all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then as gaily as if she were not raging within
her soul she turned to help poor Dottie Wetherill
who was hopelessly muddled about turning her heel.
</p>
<p>Dottie chattered on above the turmoil of her
soul, and her words were as tiny April showers sizzling
on a red hot cannon. By and by she picked up
Dottie&#8217;s dropped stitches. After all, what did such
things matter when there was <i>war</i> and men were
giving their <i>lives</i>!
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Bob says he doubts if they ever get to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
France. He says he thinks the war will be over
before half the men get trained. He says, for his
part, he&#8217;d like the trip over after the submarines
have been put out of business. It would be something
to tell about, don&#8217;t you know? But Bob
thinks the war will be over soon. Don&#8217;t you
think so, Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I think,&#8221; said Ruth exasperated
at the little prattler. It seemed so awful
for a girl with brains&mdash;or hadn&#8217;t she brains?&mdash;to
chatter on interminably in that inane fashion about
a matter of such awful portent. And yet perhaps
the child was only trying to cover up her fears, for
she all too evidently worshipped her brother.
</p>
<p>Ruth was glad when at last the morning was
over and one by one the women gathered their belongings
together and went home. She stayed
longer than the rest to put the work in order. When
they were all gone she drove around by the way of
the post office and asked the old post master who
had been there for twenty years and knew everybody,
if he could tell her the address of the boys
who had gone to camp that morning. He wrote it
down and she tucked it in her blouse saying she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
thought the Red Cross would be sending them
something soon. Then she drove thoughtfully away
to her beautiful sheltered home, where the thought
of war hardly dared to enter yet in any but a playful
form. But somehow everything was changed
within the heart of Ruth Macdonald and she looked
about on all the familiar places with new eyes.
What right had she to be living here in all this
luxury while over there men were dying every day
that she might live?
</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</div>

<p>The sun shone blindly over the broad dusty
drill-field. The men marched and wheeled, about-faced
and counter-marched in their new olive-drab
uniforms and thought of home&mdash;those that had any
homes to think about. Some who did not thought
of a home that might have been if this war had
not happened.
</p>
<p>There were times when their souls could rise to
the great occasion and their enthusiasm against the
foe could carry them to all lengths of joyful sacrifice,
but this was not one of the times. It was a
breathless Indian summer morning, and the dust
was inches thick. It rose like a soft yellow mist
over the mushroom city of forty thousand men,
brought into being at the command of a Nation&#8217;s
leader. Dust lay like a fine yellow powder over
everything. An approaching company looked like
a cloud as it drew near. One could scarcely see the
men near by for the cloud of yellow dust everywhere.
</p>
<p>The water was bad this morning when every
man was thirsty. It had been boiled for safety and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
was served warm and tasted of disinfectants. The
breakfast had been oatmeal and salty bacon swimming
in congealed grease. The &#8220;boy&#8221; in the soldier&#8217;s
body was very low indeed that morning.
The &#8220;man&#8221; with his disillusioned eyes had come
to the front. Of course this was nothing like the
hardships they would have to endure later, but it
was enough for the present to their unaccustomed
minds, and harder because they were doing nothing
that seemed worth while&mdash;just marching about and
doing sordid duties when they were all eager for the
fray and to have it over with. They had begun to see
that they were going to have to learn to wait and
be patient, to obey blindly; they&mdash;who never had
brooked commands from any one, most of them, not
even from their own parents. They had been free
as air, and they had never been tied down to certain
company. Here they were all mixed up, college
men and foreign laborers, rich and poor, cultured
and coarse, clean and defiled, and it went pretty
hard with them all. They had come, a bundle of
prejudices and wills, and they had first to learn that
every prejudice they had been born with or cultivated,
must be given up or laid aside. They were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
not their own. They belonged to a great machine.
The great perfect conception of the army as a
whole had not yet dawned upon them. They were
occupied with unpleasant details in the first experimental
stages. At first the discomforts seemed to
rise and obliterate even the great object for which
they had come, and discontent sat upon their faces.
</p>
<p>Off beyond the drill-field whichever way they
looked, there were barracks the color of the dust,
and long stark roads, new and rough, the color of
the barracks, with jitneys and trucks and men like
ants crawling furiously back and forth upon them
all animated by the same great necessity that had
brought the men here. Even the sky seemed yellow
like the dust. The trees were gone except at
the edges of the camp, cut down to make way for
more barracks, in even ranks like men.
</p>
<p>Out beyond the barracks mimic trenches were
being dug, and puppets hung in long lines for mock
enemies. There were skeleton bridges to cross,
walls to scale, embankments to jump over, and all,
everything, was that awful olive-drab color till the
souls of the new-made soldiers cried out within them
for a touch of scarlet or green or blue to relieve the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
dreary monotony. Sweat and dust and grime,
weariness, homesickness, humbled pride, these were
the tales of the first days of those men gathered from
all quarters who were pioneers in the first camps.
</p>
<p>Corporal Cameron marched his awkward squad
back and forth, through all the various man&oelig;uvres,
again and again, giving his orders in short, sharp
tones, his face set, his heart tortured with the
thought of the long months and years of this that
might be before him. The world seemed most unfriendly
to him these days. Not that it had ever
been over kind, yet always before his native wit and
happy temperament had been able to buoy him up
and carry him through hopefully. Now, however,
hope seemed gone. This war might last till he was
too old to carry out any of his dreams and pull himself
out of the place where fortune had dropped
him. Gradually one thought had been shaping itself
clearly out of the days he had spent in camp.
This life on earth was not all of existence. There
must be something bigger beyond. It wasn&#8217;t sane
and sensible to think that any God would allow such
waste of humanity as to let some suffer all the way
through with nothing beyond to compensate. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
was a meaning to the suffering. There must be.
It must be a preparation for something beyond,
infinitely better and more worth while. What was
it and how should he learn the meaning of his own
particular bit?
</p>
<p>John Cameron had never thought about religion
before in his life. He had believed in a general way
in a God, or thought he believed, and that a book
called the Bible told about Him and was the authentic
place to learn how to be good. The doubts of
the age had not touched him because he had never
had any interest in them. In the ordinary course
of events he might never have thought about them
in relation to himself until he came to die&mdash;perhaps
not then. In college he had been too much engrossed
with other things to listen to the arguments, or to
be influenced by the general atmosphere of unbelief.
He had been a boy whose inner thoughts were kept
under lock and key, and who had lived his heart
life absolutely alone, although his rich wit and bubbling
merriment had made him a general favorite
where pure fun among the fellows was going. He
loved to &#8220;rough house&#8221; as he called it, and his boyish
pranks had always been the talk of the town,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
the envied of the little boys; but no one knew his
real, serious thoughts. Not even his mother, strong
and self-repressed like himself, had known how to
get down beneath the surface and commune with
him. Perhaps she was afraid or shy.
</p>
<p>Now that he was really alone among all this
mob of men of all sorts and conditions, he had
retired more and more into the inner sanctuary of
self and tried to think out the meaning of life. From
the chaos that reigned in his mind he presently
selected a few things that he called &#8220;facts&#8221; from
which to work. These were &#8220;God, Hereafter,
Death.&#8221; These things he must reckon with. He
had been working on a wrong hypothesis all his life.
He had been trying to live for this world as if it
were the end and aim of existence, and now this war
had come and this world had suddenly melted into
chaos. It appeared that he and thousands of others
must probably give up their part in this world before
they had hardly tried it, if they would set things
right again for those that should come after. But,
even if he had lived out his ordinary years in peace
and success, and had all that life could give him, it
would not have lasted long, seventy years or so, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
what were they after they were past? No, there
was something beyond or it all wouldn&#8217;t have been
made&mdash;this universe with the carefully thought out
details working harmoniously one with another. It
wouldn&#8217;t have been worth while otherwise. There
would have been no reason for a heart life.
</p>
<p>There were boys and men in the army who
thought otherwise. Who had accepted this life as
being all. Among these were the ones who when
they found they were taken in the draft and must
go to camp, had spent their last three weeks of freedom
drunk because they wanted to get all the
&#8220;fun&#8221; they could out of life that was left to them.
They were the men who were plunging into all the
sin they could find before they went away to fight
because they felt they had but a little time to live
and what did it matter? But John Cameron was
not one of these. His soul would not let him alone
until he had thought it all out, and he had come thus
far with these three facts, &#8220;God, Death, A Life
Hereafter.&#8221; He turned these over in his mind for
days and then he changed their order, &#8220;<i>Death, A
Life Hereafter, God</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Death was the grim person he was going forth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to meet one of these days or months on the field of
France or Italy, or somewhere &#8220;over there.&#8221; He
was not to wait for Death to come and get him as
had been the old order. This was WAR and he was
going out to challenge Death. He was convinced
that whether Death was a servant of God or the
Devil, in some way it would make a difference with
his own personal life hereafter, how he met Death.
He was not satisfied with just meeting Death
bravely, with the ardor of patriotism in his breast,
as he heard so many about him talk in these days.
That was well so far as it went, but it did not solve
the mystery of the future life nor make him sure
how he would stand in that other world to which
Death stood ready to escort him presently. Death
might be victor over his body, but he wanted to be
sure that Death should not also kill that something
within him which he felt must live forever. He
turned it over for days and came to the conclusion
that the only one who could help him was God.
God was the beginning of it all. If there was a
God He must be available to help a soul in a time
like this. There must be a way to find God and get
the secret of life, and so be ready to meet Death
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
that Death should not conquer anything but the
body. How could one find God? Had anybody
ever found Him? Did anyone really <i>think</i> they
had found Him? These were questions that beat
in upon his soul day after day as he drilled his men
and went through the long hard hours of discipline,
or lay upon his straw tick at night while a hundred
and fifty other men about him slept.
</p>
<p>His mother&#8217;s secret attempts at religion had
been too feeble and too hidden in her own breast to
have made much of an impression upon him. She
had only <i>hoped</i> her faith was founded upon a rock.
She had not <i>known</i>. And so her buffeted soul had
never given evidence to her son of hidden holy
refuge where he might flee with her in time of need.
</p>
<p>Now and then the vision of a girl blurred across
his thoughts uncertainly, like a bright moth hovering
in the distance whose shadow fell across his
dusty path. But it was far away and vague, and
only a glance in her eyes belonged to him. She
was not of his world.
</p>
<p>He looked up to the yellow sky through the
yellow dust, and his soul cried out to find the way
to God before he had to meet Death, but the heavens
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
seemed like molten brass. Not that he was afraid
of death with a physical fear, but that his soul
recoiled from being conquered by it and he felt convinced
that there was a way to meet it with a smile
of assurance if only he could find it out. He had
read that people had met it that way. Was it all
their imagination? The mere illusion of a fanatical
brain? Well, he would try to find out God. He
would put himself in the places where God ought to
be, and when he saw any indication that God was
there he would cry out until he made God hear him!
</p>
<p>The day he came to that conclusion was Sunday
and he went over to the Y.M.C.A. Auditorium.
They were having a Mary Pickford moving picture
show there. If he had happened to go at any time
during the morning he might have heard some fine
sermons and perhaps have found the right man to
help him, but this was evening and the men were
being amused.
</p>
<p>He stood for a few moments and watched the
pretty show. The sunlight on Mary&#8217;s beautiful
hair, as it fell glimmering through the trees in the
picture reminded him of the red-gold lights on
Ruth Macdonald&#8217;s hair the morning he left home,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and with a sigh he turned away and walked to the
edge of camp where the woods were still standing.
</p>
<p>Alone he looked up to the starry sky. Amusement
was not what he wanted now. He was in
search of something vague and great that would
satisfy, and give him a reason for being and suffering
and dying perhaps. He called it God because
he had no other name for it. Red-gold hair might
be for others but not for him. He might not take
it where he would and he would not take it where it
lay easy to get. If he had been in the same class
with some other fellows he knew he would have
wasted no time on follies. He would have gone for
the very highest, finest woman. But there! What
was the use! Besides, even if he had been&mdash;and he
had had&mdash;every joy of life here was but a passing
show and must sometime come to an end. And at the
end would be this old problem. Sometime he would
have had to realize it, even if war had not come and
brought the revelation prematurely. What was it
that he wanted? How could he find out how to die?
Where was God?
</p>
<p>But the stars were high and cold and gave no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
answer, and the whispering leaves, although they
soothed him, sighed and gave no help.
</p>
<p>The feeling was still with him next morning
when the mail was distributed. There would be
nothing for him. His mother had written her
weekly letter and it had reached him the day before.
He could expect nothing for several days now.
Other men were getting sheaves of letters. How
friendless he seemed among them all. One had a
great chocolate cake that a girl had sent him and
the others were crowding around to get a bit. It
was doubtful if the laughing owner got more than
a bite himself. He might have been one of the
group if he had chosen. They all liked him well
enough, although they knew him very little as yet,
for he had kept much to himself. But he turned
sharply away from them and went out. Somehow
he was not in the mood for fun. He felt he must be
growing morbid but he could not throw it off that
morning. It all seemed so hopeless, the things
he had tried to do in life and the slow progress
he had made upward; and now to have it all
blocked by war!
</p>
<p>None of the other fellows ever dreamed that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
was lonely, big, husky, handsome fellow that he
was, with a continuous joke on his lips for those he
had chosen as associates, with an arm of iron and
a jaw that set like steel, grim and unmistakably
brave. The awkward squad as they wrathfully
obeyed his stern orders would have told you he had
no heart, the way he worked them, and would not
have believed that he was just plain homesick and
lonesome for some one to care for him.
</p>
<p>He was not hungry that day when the dinner
call came, and flung himself down under a scrub
oak outside the barracks while the others rushed in
with their mess kits ready for beans or whatever
was provided for them. He was glad that they
were gone, glad that he might have the luxury of
being miserable all alone for a few minutes. He
felt strangely as if he were going to cry, and yet
he didn&#8217;t know what about. Perhaps he was going
to be sick. That would be horrible down in that
half finished hospital with hardly any equipment
yet! He must brace up and put an end to such
softness. It was all in the idea anyway.
</p>
<p>Then a great hand came down upon his shoulder
with a mighty slap and he flung himself bolt upright
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
with a frown to find his comrade whose bunk
was next to his in the barracks. He towered over
Cameron polishing his tin plate with a vigor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, you boob?
There&#8217;s roast beef and its good. Cooky saved a
piece for you. I told him you&#8217;d come. Go in and
get it quick! There&#8217;s a letter for you, too, in the
office. I&#8217;d have brought it only I was afraid I would
miss you. Here, take my mess kit and hurry!
There&#8217;s some cracker-jack pickles, too, little sweet
ones! Step lively, or some one will swipe them all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron arose, accepted his friend&#8217;s dishes and
sauntered into the mess hall. The letter couldn&#8217;t be
very important. His mother had no time to write
again soon, and there was no one else. It was likely
an advertisement or a formal greeting from some
of the organizations at home. They did that about
fortnightly, the Red Cross, the Woman&#8217;s Club, The
Emergency Aid, The Fire Company. It was kind
in them but he wasn&#8217;t keen about it just then. It
could wait until he got his dinner. They didn&#8217;t have
roast beef every day, and now that he thought about
it he was hungry.
</p>
<p>He almost forgot the letter after dinner until a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
comrade reminded him, handing over a thick delicately
scented envelope with a silver crest on the
back. The boys got off their kidding about &#8220;the
girl he&#8217;d left behind him&#8221; and he answered with
his old good-natured grin that made them love him,
letting them think he had all kinds of girls, for the
dinner had somewhat restored his spirits, but he
crumpled the letter into his pocket and got away
into the woods to read it.
</p>
<p>Deliberately he walked down the yellow road,
up over the hill by the signal corps tents, across
Wig-Wag Park to the woods beyond, and sat down
on a log with his letter. He told himself that it was
likely one of those fool letters the fellows were getting
all the time from silly girls who were uniform-crazy.
He wouldn&#8217;t answer it, of course, and he
felt a kind of contempt with himself for being weak
enough to read it even to satisfy his curiosity.
</p>
<p>Then he tore open the envelope half angrily and
a faint whiff of violets floated out to him. Over his
head a meadow lark trilled a long sweet measure,
and glad surprise suddenly entered into his soul.

</div>

<p>The letter was written in a fine beautiful hand
and even before he saw the silver monogram at the
top, he knew who was the writer, though he did not
even remember to have seen the writing before:
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Friend:</span>
</p>
<p>I have hesitated a long time before writing because I do
not know that I have the right to call you a friend, or even an
acquaintance in the commonly accepted sense of that term. It
is so long since you and I went to school together, and we
have been so widely separated since then that perhaps you do
not even remember me, and may consider my letter an intrusion.
I hope not, for I should hate to rank with the girls who are
writing to strangers under the license of mistaken patriotism.
</p>
<p>My reason for writing you is that a good many years ago
you did something very nice and kind for me one day, in fact
you helped me twice, although I don&#8217;t suppose you knew it.
Then the other day, when you were going to camp and I sat
in my car and watched you, it suddenly came over me that you
were doing it again; this time a great big wonderful thing
for me; and doing it just as quietly and inconsequentially as you
did it before; and all at once I realized how splendid it was
and wanted to thank you.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>It came over me, too, that I had never thanked you for the
other times, and very likely you never dreamed that you had
done anything at all.
</p>
<p>You see I was only a little girl, very much frightened,
because Chuck Woodcock had teased me about my curls and
said that he was going to catch me and cut them off, and send
me home to my aunt that way, and she would turn me out of
the house. He had been frightening me for several days, so
that I was afraid to go to school alone, and yet I would not
tell my aunt because I was afraid she would take me away
from the Public School and send me to a Private School which
I did not want. But that day I had seen Chuck Woodcock
steal in behind the hedge, ahead of the girls. The others were
ahead of me and I was all out of breath&mdash;running to catch up
because I was afraid to pass him alone; and just as I got near
two of them,&mdash;Mary Wurts and Caroline Meadows, you remember
them, don&#8217;t you?&mdash;they gave a scream and pitched headlong
on the sidewalk. They had tripped over a wire he had stretched
from the tree to the hedge. I stopped short and got behind a
tree, and I remember how the tears felt in my throat, but I
was afraid to let them out because Chuck would call me a crybaby
and I hated that. And just then you came along behind
me and jumped through the hedge and caught Chuck and gave
him an awful whipping. &#8220;Licking&#8221; I believe we called it
then. I remember how condemned I felt as I ran by the hedge
and knew in my heart that I was glad you were hurting him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
because he had been so cruel to me. He used to pull my curls
whenever he sat behind me in recitation.
</p>
<p>I remember you came in to school late with your hair all
mussed up beautifully, and a big tear in your coat, and a streak
of mud on your face. I was so worried lest the teacher would
find out you had been fighting and make you stay after school.
Because you see I knew in my heart that you had been winning
a battle for me, and if anybody had to stay after school I
wished it could be me because of what you had done for me.
But you came in laughing as you always did, and looking as
if nothing in the world unusual had happened, and when you
passed my desk you threw before me the loveliest pink rose bud
I ever saw. That was the second thing you did for me.
</p>
<p>Perhaps you won&#8217;t understand how nice that was, either,
for you see you didn&#8217;t know how unhappy I had been. The
girls hadn&#8217;t been very friendly with me. They told me I was
&#8220;stuck up,&#8221; and they said I was too young to be in their
classes anyway and ought to go to Kindergarten. It was all
very hard for me because I longed to be big and have them
for my friends. I was very lonely in that great big house
with only my aunt and grandfather for company. But the
girls wouldn&#8217;t be friends at all until they saw you give me that
rose, and that turned the tide. They were crazy about you,
every one of them, and, they made up to me after that and told
me their secrets and shared their lunch and we had great times.
And it was all because you gave me the rose that day. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
rose itself was lovely and I was tremendously happy over it
for its own sake, but it meant a whole lot to me besides, and
opened the little world of school to my longing feet. I always
wanted to thank you for it, but you looked as if you didn&#8217;t
want me to, so I never dared; and lately I wasn&#8217;t quite sure
you knew me, because you never looked my way any more.
</p>
<p>But when I saw you standing on the platform the other
day with the other drafted men, it all came over me how you
were giving up the life you had planned to go out and fight
for me and other girls like me. I hadn&#8217;t thought of the war
that way before, although, of course, I had heard that thought
expressed in speeches; but it never struck into my heart until
I saw the look on your face. It was a kind of &#8220;knightliness,&#8221;
if there is such a word, and when I thought about it I realized
it was the very same look you had worn when you burst
through the hedge after Chuck Woodcock, and again when
you came back and threw that rose on my desk. Although,
you had a big, broad boy&#8217;s-grin on your face then, and were
chewing gum I remember quite distinctly; and the other day
you looked so serious and sorry as if it meant a great deal to
you to go, but you were giving up everything gladly without
even thinking of hesitating. The look on your face was a man&#8217;s
look, not a boy&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>It has meant so much to me to realize this last great thing
that you are doing for me and for the other girls of our
country that I had to write and tell you how much I appreciate it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>I have been wondering whether some one has been knitting
you a sweater yet, and the other things that they knit for soldiers;
and if they haven&#8217;t, whether you would let me send them
to you? It is the only thing I can do for you who have done so
much for me.
</p>
<p>I hope you will not think I am presuming to have written
this on the strength of a childish acquaintance. I wish you all
honors that can come to you on such a quest as yours, and I
had almost said all good luck, only that that word sounds too
frivolous and pagan for such a serious matter; so I will say
all safety for a swift accomplishment of your task and a swift
homecoming. I used to think when I was a little child that
nothing could ever hurt you or make you afraid, and I cannot
help feeling now that you will come through the fire unscathed.
May I hope to hear from you about the sweater and things?
And may I sign myself
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right;  margin-right:8em;'>Your friend? </p>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Ruth Macdonald.</span></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>John Cameron lifted his eyes from the paper at
last and looked up at the sky. Had it ever been so
blue before? At the trees. What whispering wonders
of living green! Was that only a bird that
was singing that heavenly song&mdash;a meadow lark,
not an angel? Why had he never appreciated
meadow larks before?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>He rested his head back against a big oak and
his soldier&#8217;s hat fell off on the ground. He closed
his eyes and the burden of loneliness that had borne
down upon him all these weeks in the camp lifted
from his heart. Then he tried to realize what had
come to him. Ruth Macdonald, the wonder and
admiration of his childhood days, the admired and
envied of the home town, the petted beauty at whose
feet every man fell, the girl who had everything that
wealth could purchase! She had remembered the
little old rose he had dared to throw on her desk,
and had bridged the years with this letter!
</p>
<p>He was carried back in spirit to the day he left
for camp. To the look in her eyes as he moved
away on the train. The look had been real then,
and not just a fleeting glance helped out by his
fevered imagination. There had been true friendliness
in her eyes. She had intended to say good-bye
to him! She had put him on a level with her
own beautiful self. She had knighted him, as it
were, and sent him forth! Even the war had become
different since she chose to think he was going
forth to fight her battles. What a sacred trust!
</p>
<p>Afar in the distance a bugle sounded that called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
to duty. He had no idea how the time had flown.
He glanced at his wrist watch and was amazed.
He sprang to his feet and strode over the ground,
but the way no longer seemed dusty and blinded
with sunshine. It shone like a path of glory before
his willing feet, and he went to his afternoon round
of duties like a new man. He had a friend, a real
friend, one that he had known a long time. There
was no fear that she was just writing to him to get
one more soldier at her feet as some girls would
have done. Her letter was too frank and sincere
to leave a single doubt about what she meant. He
would take her at her word.
</p>
<p>Sometime during the course of the afternoon it
occurred to him to look at the date of the letter, and
he found to his dismay that it had been written
nearly four weeks before and had been travelling
around through various departments in search of
him, because it had not the correct address. He
readily guessed that she had not wanted to ask for
his company and barracks; she would not have
known who to ask. She did not know his mother,
and who else was there? His old companions were
mostly gone to France or camp somewhere.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>And now, since all this time had elapsed she
would think he had not cared, had scorned her letter
or thought it unmaidenly! He was filled with dismay
and anxiety lest he had hurt her frankness by
his seeming indifference. And the knitted things,
the wonderful things that she had made with her
fair hands! Would she have given them to some
one else by this time? Of course, it meant little to
her save as a kind of acknowledgment for something
she thought he had done for her as a child, but
they meant so much to him! Much more than they
ought to do, he knew, for he was in no position to
allow himself to become deeply attached to even
the handiwork of any girl in her position. However,
nobody need ever know how much he cared,
had always cared, for the lovely little girl with her
blue eyes, her long curls, her shy sweet smile and
modest ways, who had seemed to him like an angel
from heaven when he was a boy. She had said he
did not know that he was helping her when he
burst through the hedge on the cowering Chuck
Woodcock; and he would likely never dare to tell
her that it was because he saw her fright and saw
her hide behind that tree that he went to investigate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
and so was able to administer a just punishment.
He had picked that rose from the extreme west
corner of a great petted rose bush on the Wainwright
lawn, reaching through an elaborate iron
fence to get it as he went cross-lots back to school.
He would call it stealing now to do that same, but
then it had been in the nature of a holy rite offered
to a vestal virgin. Yet he must have cast it down
with the grin of an imp, boorish urchin that he
was; and he remembered blushing hotly in the dark
afterwards at his presumption, as he thought of it
alone at night. And all the time she had been liking
it. The little girl&mdash;the little sweet girl! She had
kept it in her heart and remembered it!
</p>
<p>His heart was light as air as he went back to
the barracks for retreat. A miracle had been
wrought for him which changed everything. No, he
was not presuming on a friendly letter. Maybe there
would be fellows who would think there wasn&#8217;t much
in just a friendly letter to a lonely soldier, and a
sweater or two more or less. But then they would
never have known what it was to be so lonely for
friendship, real friendship, as he was.
</p>
<p>He would hurry through supper and get to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
Y.M.C.A. hut to write her an answer. He would
explain how the letter had been delayed and say he
hoped she had not given the things away to someone
else. He began planning sentences as he stood
at attention during the captain&#8217;s inspection at retreat.
Somehow the captain was tiresomely particular
about the buttons and pocket flaps and little
details to-night. He waited impatiently for the
command to break ranks, and was one of the first
at the door of the mess hall waiting for supper, his
face alight, still planning what he would say in that
letter and wishing he could get some fine stationery
to write upon; wondering if there was any to be had
with his caduces on it.
</p>
<p>At supper he bubbled with merriment. An old
schoolmate might have thought him rejuvenated.
He wore his schoolboy grin and rattled off puns and
jokes, keeping the mess hall in a perfect roar.
</p>
<p>At last he was out in the cool of the evening with
the wonderful sunset off in the west, on his way to
the Y.M.C.A. hut. He turned a corner swinging
into the main road and there, coming toward
him, not twenty feet away, he saw Lieutenant
Wainwright!
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>VI</h2>
</div>

<p>There was no possible way to avoid meeting
him. John Cameron knew that with the first glance.
He also knew that Wainwright had recognized him
at once and was lifting his chin already with that
peculiar, disagreeable tilt of triumph that had
always been so maddening to one who knew the
small mean nature of the man.
</p>
<p>Of course, there was still time to turn deliberately
about and flee in the other direction, but that
would be all too obvious, and an open confession
of weakness. John Cameron was never at any
time a coward.
</p>
<p>His firm lips set a trifle more sternly than usual,
his handsome head was held high with fine military
bearing. He came forward without faltering for
even so much as the fraction of a waver. There
was not a flicker in his eyes set straight ahead. One
would never have known from his looks that he
recognized the oncoming man, or had so much as
realized that an officer was approaching, yet his
brain was doing some rapid calculation. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
said in his heart if not openly that he would never
salute this man. He had many times in their home
town openly passed him without salute because he
had absolutely no respect for him, and felt that he
owed it to his sense of the fitness of things not to
give him deference, but that was a different matter
from camp. He knew that Wainwright was in a
position to do him injury, and no longer stood in
fear of a good thrashing from him as at home, because
here he could easily have the offender put in
the guard house and disgraced forever. Nothing,
of course, would delight him more than thus to
humiliate his sworn enemy. Yet Cameron walked
on knowing that he had resolved not to salute him.
</p>
<p>It was not merely pride in his own superiority.
It was contempt for the nature of the man, for his
low contemptible plots and tricks, and cunning
ways, for his entire lack of principle, and his utter
selfishness and heartlessness, that made Cameron
feel justified in his attitude toward Wainwright.
&#8220;He is nothing but a Hun at heart,&#8221; he told himself
bitterly.
</p>
<p>But the tables were turned. Wainwright was
no longer in his home town where his detestable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
pranks had goaded many of his neighbors and fellowtownsmen
into a cordial hatred of him. He was
in a great military camp, vested with a certain
amount of authority, with the right to report those
under him; who in turn could not retaliate by telling
what they knew of him because it was a court-martial
offense for a private to report an officer.
Well, naturally the United States was not supposed
to have put men in authority who needed reporting.
Cameron, of course, realized that these things had
to be in order to maintain military discipline. But
it was inevitable that some unworthy ones should
creep in, and Wainwright was surely one of those
unworthy ones. He would not bend to him, officer,
or no officer. What did he care what happened to
himself? Who was there to care but his mother?
And she would understand if the news should happen
to penetrate to the home town, which was hardly
likely. Those who knew him would not doubt him,
those who did not mattered little. There was really
no one who would care. Stay! A letter crackled
in his breast pocket and a cold chill of horror
struggled up from his heart. Suppose <i>she</i> should
hear of it! Yes, he would care for that!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>They were almost meeting now and Cameron&#8217;s
eyes were straight ahead staring hard at the big
green shape of the theatre a quarter of a mile away.
His face under its usual control showed no sign of
the tumult in his heart, which flamed with a sudden
despair against a fate that had placed him in such
a desperate situation. If there were a just power
who controlled the affairs of men, how could it let
such things happen to one who had always tried to
live up upright life? It seemed for that instant
as if all the unfairness and injustice of his own
hard life had culminated in that one moment
when he would have to do or not do and bear
the consequences.
</p>
<p>Then suddenly out from the barracks close at
hand with brisk step and noble bearing came Captain
La Rue, swinging down the walk into the road
straight between the two men and stopped short in
front of Cameron with a light of real welcome in his
eyes, as he lifted his hand to answer the salute which
the relieved Cameron instantly flashed at him.
</p>
<p>In that second Lieutenant Wainwright flung
past them with a curt salute to the higher officer and
a glare at the corporal which the latter seemed not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to see. It was so simultaneous with Cameron&#8217;s
salute of La Rue that nobody on earth could say
that the salute had not included the lieutenant, yet
both the lieutenant and the corporal knew that it
had not; and Wainwright&#8217;s brow was dark with
intention as he turned sharply up the walk to the
barracks which the captain had just left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just coming in search of you, Cameron,&#8221;
said the captain with a twinkle in his eyes, and his
voice was clearly distinct to Wainwright as he loitered
in the barracks doorway to listen, &#8220;I went
down to Washington yesterday and put in the
strongest plea I knew how for your transfer. I
hope it will go through all right. There is no one
else out for the job and you are just the man
for the place. It will be a great comfort to have
you with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few more words and the busy man moved on
eluding Cameron&#8217;s earnest thanks and leaving him
to pursue his course to the Y.M.C.A. hut with a
sense of soothing and comfort. It never occurred
to either of them that their brief conversation
had been overheard, and would not have disturbed
them if it had.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>Lieutenant Wainwright lingered on the steps
of the barracks with a growing curiosity and satisfaction.
The enemy were playing right into his
hands: <i>both</i> the enemy&mdash;for he hated Captain La Rue
as sin always hates the light.
</p>
<p>He lounged about the barracks in deep thought
for a few minutes and then made a careful toilet
and went out.
</p>
<p>He knew exactly where to go and how to use his
influence, which was not small, although not personal.
It was characteristic of the man that it made
no difference to him that the power he was wielding
was a borrowed power whose owner would have
been the last man to have done what he was about
to do with it. He had never in his life hesitated
about getting whatever he wanted by whatever
means presented itself. He was often aware that
people gave him what he wanted merely to get
rid of him, but this did not alloy his pleasure in
his achievement.
</p>
<p>He was something of a privileged character in
the high place to which he betook himself, on account
of the supreme regard which was held for the uncle,
a mighty automobile king, through whose influence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
he had obtained his commission. So far he had not
availed himself of his privileges too often and had
therefore not as yet outworn his welcome, for he
was a true diplomat. He entered this evening with
just the right shade of delicate assurance and
humble affrontery to assure him a cordial welcome,
and gracefully settled himself into the friendliness
that was readily extended to him. He was versed in
all the ways of the world and when he chose could
put up a good appearance. He knew that for the
sake of his father&#8217;s family and more especially because
of his uncle&#8217;s high standing, this great official
whom he was calling upon was bound to be nice to
him for a time. So he bided his time till a few
other officials had left and his turn came.
</p>
<p>The talk was all personal, a few words about his
relatives and then questions about himself, his commission,
how he liked it, and how things were going
with him. Mere form and courtesy, but he knew
how to use the conversation for his own ends:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m getting along fine and dandy!&#8221; he declared
effusively, &#8220;I&#8217;m just crazy about camp! I
like the life! But I&#8217;ll tell you what makes me tired.
It&#8217;s these little common guys running around fussing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
about their jobs and trying to get a lot of pull
to get into some other place. Now there&#8217;s an instance
of that in our company, a man from my home
town, no account whatever and never was, but he&#8217;s
got it in his head that he&#8217;s a square peg in a round
hole and he wants to be transferred. He shouts
about it from morning till night trying to get everybody
to help him, and at last I understand he&#8217;s hoodwinked
one captain into thinking he&#8217;s the salt of
the earth, and they are plotting together to get him
transferred. I happened to overhear them talking
about it just now, how they are going to this one
and that one in Washington to get things fixed to
suit them. They think they&#8217;ve got the right dope
on things all right and it&#8217;s going through for him
to get his transfer. It makes me sick. He&#8217;s no
more fit for a commission than my dog, not as fit, for
he could at least obey orders. This fellow never did
anything but what he pleased. I&#8217;ve known him
since we were kids and never liked him. But he has
a way with him that gets people till they understand
him. It&#8217;s too bad when the country needs real men
to do their duty that a fellow like that can get a
commission when he is utterly inefficient besides
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
being a regular breeder of trouble. But, of course,
I can&#8217;t tell anybody what I know about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you needn&#8217;t worry, Wainwright. They
can&#8217;t make any transfers without sending them up
to me, and you may be good and sure I&#8217;m not transferring
anybody just now without a good reason, no
matter who is asking it. He&#8217;s in your company, is
he? And where does he ask to be transferred? Just
give me his name. I&#8217;ll make a note of it. If it
ever comes up I&#8217;ll know how to finish him pretty
suddenly. Though I doubt if it does. People are
not pulling wires just now. This is <i>war</i> and
everything means business. However, if I find
there has been wire-pulling I shall know how to
deal with it summarily. It&#8217;s a court-martial offense,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They passed on to other topics, and Wainwright
with his little eyes gleaming triumphantly soon
took himself out into the starlight knowing that
he had done fifteen minutes&#8217; good work and not
wishing to outdo it. He strolled contentedly back
to officers&#8217; quarters wearing a more complacent
look on his heavy features. He would teach John
Cameron to ignore him!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>Meantime John Cameron with his head among
the stars walked the dusty camp streets and forgot
the existence of Lieutenant Wainwright. A glow
of gratitude had flooded his soul at sight of his beloved
captain, whom he hoped soon to be able to call
<i>his</i> captain. Unconsciously he walked with more
self-respect as the words of confidence and trust
rang over again in his ears. Unconsciously the little
matters of personal enmity became smaller, of less
importance, beside the greater things of life in which
he hoped soon to have a real part. If he got this
transfer it meant a chance to work with a great man
in a great way that would not only help the war but
would be of great value to him in this world after
the war was over. It was good to have the friendship
of a man like that, fine, clean, strong, intellectual,
kind, just, human, gentle as a woman, yet stern
against all who deviated from the path of right.
</p>
<p>The dusk was settling into evening and twinkling
lights gloomed out amid the misty, dust-laden
air. Snatches of wild song chorused out from
open windows:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>She&#8217;s my lady, my baby,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>She&#8217;s cock-eyed, she&#8217;s crazy.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>The twang of a banjo trailed in above the
voices, with a sound of scuffling. Loud laughter
broke the thread of the song leaving <i>&#8220;Mary Ann!&#8221;</i>
to soar out alone. Then the chorus took it up
once more:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>All her teeth are false</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>From eating Rochelle salts&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>She&#8217;s my freckled-faced, consumptive MARY ANN-N-N!</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Cameron turned in at the quiet haven of the
Y.M.C.A. hut, glad to leave the babel sounds outside.
Somehow they did not fit his mood to-night,
although there were times when he could roar the
outlandish gibberish with the best of them. But
to-night he was on such a wonderful sacred errand
bent, that it seemed as though he wanted to keep his
soul from contact with rougher things lest somehow
it might get out of tune and so unfit him for
the task before him.
</p>
<p>And then when he had seated himself before the
simple desk he looked at the paper with discontent.
True, it was all that was provided and it was good
enough for ordinary letters, but this letter to her
was different. He wished he had something better.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
To think he was really writing to <i>her</i>! And now
that he was here with the paper before him what
was he to say? Words seemed to have deserted
him. How should he address her?
</p>
<p>It was not until he had edged over to the end
of the bench away from everybody else and taken
out the precious letter that he gained confidence and
took up his pen:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear friend:&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Why, he would call
her his friend, of course, that was what she had
called him. And as he wrote he seemed to see her
again as she sat in her car by the station the day he
started on his long, long trail and their eyes had
met. Looking so into her eyes again, he wrote
straight from his soul:
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Friend</span>:
</p>
<p>Your letter has just reached me after travelling about for
weeks. I am not going to try to tell you how wonderful it is
to me to have it. In fact, the wonder began that morning I
left home when you smiled at me and waved a friendly farewell.
It was a great surprise to me. I had not supposed until that
moment that you remembered my existence. Why should you?
And it has never been from lack of desire to do so that I
failed to greet you when we passed in the street. I did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
think that I, a mere little hoodlum from your infant days,
had a right to intrude upon your grown-up acquaintance without
a hint from you that such recognition would be agreeable. I
never blamed you for not speaking of course. Perhaps I
didn&#8217;t give you the chance. I simply thought I had grown
out of your memory as was altogether natural. It was indeed
a pleasant experience to see that light of friendliness in your
eyes at the station that day, and to know it was a real personal
recognition and not just a patriotic gush of enthusiasm for the
whole shabby lot of us draftees starting out to an unknown
future. I thanked you in my heart for that little bit of personal
friendliness but I never expected to have an opportunity to
thank you in words, nor to have the friendliness last after I
had gone away. When your letter came this morning it sure
was some pleasant surprise. I know you have a great many
friends, and plenty of people to write letters to, but somehow
there was a real note of comradeship in the one you wrote me,
not as if you just felt sorry for me because I had to go off to war
and fight and maybe get killed. It was as if the conditions
of the times had suddenly swept away a lot of foolish conventions
of the world, which may all have their good use perhaps
at times, but at a time like this are superfluous, and you had
just gravely and sweetly offered me an old friend&#8217;s sympathy
and good will. As such I have taken it and am rejoicing in it.
</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make any mistake about this, however. I never have
forgotten you or the rose! I stole it from the Wainwright&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
yard after I got done licking Chuck, and I had a fight with
Hal Wainwright over it which almost finished the rose, and
nearly got me expelled from school before I got through
with it. Hal told his mother and she took it to the school
board. I was a pretty tough little rascal in those days I guess
and no doubt needed some lickings myself occasionally. But
I remember I almost lost my nerve when I got back to school
that day and came within an ace of stuffing the rose in my
pocket instead of throwing it on your desk. I never dreamed
the rose would be anything to you. It was only my way of
paying tribute to you. You seemed to me something like a
rose yourself, just dropped down out of heaven you know, you
were so little and pink and gold with such great blue eyes.
Pardon me. I don&#8217;t mean to be too personal. You don&#8217;t mind
a big hobbledehoy&#8217;s admiration, do you? You were only a baby;
but I would have licked any boy in town that lifted a word or
a finger against you. And to think you really needed my help!
It certainly would have lifted me above the clouds to have
known it then!
</p>
<p>And now about this war business. Of course it is a rough
job, and somebody had to do it for the world. I was glad and
willing to do my part; but it makes a different thing out of it
to be called a knight, and I guess I&#8217;ll look at it a little more
respectfully now. If a life like mine can protect a life like
yours from some of the things those Germans are putting over
I&#8217;ll gladly give it. I&#8217;ve sized it up that a man couldn&#8217;t do a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
bigger thing for the world anyhow he planned it than to make
the world safe for a life like yours; so me for what they call
&#8220;the supreme sacrifice,&#8221; and it won&#8217;t be any sacrifice at all if
it helps you!
</p>
<p>No, I haven&#8217;t got a sweater or those other things that go
with those that you talk about. Mother hasn&#8217;t time to knit
and I never was much of a lady&#8217;s man, I guess you know if
you know me at all. Or perhaps you don&#8217;t. But anyhow I&#8217;d
be wonderfully pleased to wear a sweater that you knit,
although it seems a pretty big thing for you to do for me.
However, if knitting is your job in this war, and I wouldn&#8217;t be
robbing any other better fellow, I certainly would just love
to have it.
</p>
<p>If you could see this big dusty monotonous olive-drab camp
you would know what a bright spot your letter and the thought
of a real friend has made in it. I suppose you have been thinking
all this time that I was neglectful because I didn&#8217;t answer,
but it was all the fault of someone who gave you the wrong
address. I am hoping you will forgive me for the delay and
that some day you will have time to write to me again.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right;  margin-right:8em;'>Sincerely and proudly,</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>As he walked back to his barracks in the starlight
his heart was filled with a great peace. What
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
a thing it was to have been able to speak to her on
paper and let her know his thoughts of her. It was
as if after all these years he had been able to pluck
another trifling rose and lay it at her lovely feet.
Her knight! It was the fulfillment of all his boyish
dreams!
</p>
<p>He had entrusted his letter to the Y.M.C.A.
man to mail as he was going out of camp that night
and would mail it in Baltimore, ensuring it an immediate
start. Now he began to speculate whether
it would reach its destination by morning and be
delivered with the morning mail. He felt as excited
and impatient as a child over it.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice above him in a barracks window
rang out with a familiar guffaw, and the words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, man, I can&#8217;t! Didn&#8217;t I tell you I&#8217;m
going to marry Ruth Macdonald before I go!
There wouldn&#8217;t be time for that and the other, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Something in his heart grew cold with pain and
horror, and something in his motive power stopped
suddenly and halted his feet on the sidewalk in the
grade cut below the officers&#8217; barracks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw! A week more won&#8217;t make any difference,&#8221;
drawled another familiar voice, &#8220;I say, Hal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
she&#8217;s just crazy about you and you could get no end
of information out of her if you tried. All she asks
is that you tell what you know about a few little
things that don&#8217;t matter anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you I can&#8217;t, man. If Ruth found
out about the girl the mischief would be to pay. She
wouldn&#8217;t stand for another girl&mdash;not that kind of a
girl, you know, and there wouldn&#8217;t be time for me
to explain and smooth things over before I go across
the Pond. I tell you I&#8217;ve made up my mind
about this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The barracks door slammed shut on the voices
and Corporal Cameron&#8217;s heart gave a great jump
upwards in his breast and went on. Slowly, dizzily
he came to his senses and moved on automatically
toward his own quarters.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
<h2>VII</h2>
</div>

<p>He had passed the quarters of the signal corps
before the thought of the letter he had just written
came to his mind. Then he stopped short, gave one
agonizing glance toward his barracks only a few
feet away, realized that it was nearly time for bed
call and that he could not possibly make it if he
went back, then whirled about and started out on a
wild run like a madman over the ground he had just
traveled. He was not conscious of carrying on a
train of thought as he ran, his only idea was to get
to the Y.M.C.A. hut before the man had left with
the letter. Never should his childhood&#8217;s enemy
have that letter to sneer over!
</p>
<p>All the pleasant phrases which had flowed from
his pen so easily but a few moments before seemed
to flare now in letters of fire before his blood-shot
eyes as he bounded over the ground. To think he
should have lowered himself and weakened his position
so, as to write to the girl who was soon to be the
wife of that contemptible puppy!
</p>
<p>The bugles began to sound taps here and there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
in the barracks as he flew past, but they meant nothing
to him. Breathless he arrived at the Y.M.C.A.
hut just as the last light was being put out. A dark
figure stood on the steps as he halted entirely
winded, and tried to gasp out: &#8220;Where is Mr.
Hathaway?&#8221; to the assistant who was locking up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he left five minutes after you did,&#8221; said
the man with a yawn. &#8220;The rector came by in his
car and took him along. Say, you&#8217;ll be late getting
in, Corporal, taps sounded almost five minutes ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a low exclamation of disgust and dismay
Cameron turned and started back again in a long
swinging stride, his face flushing hotly in the dark
over his double predicament. He had gone back
for nothing and got himself subject to a calling
down, a thing which he had avoided scrupulously
since coming to camp, but he was so miserable over
the other matter that it seemed a thing of no moment
to him now. He was altogether occupied with
metaphorically kicking himself for having answered
that letter; for having mailed it so soon without ever
stopping to read it over or give himself a chance to
reconsider. He might have known, he might have
remembered that Ruth Macdonald was no comrade
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
for him; that she was a neighbor of the Wainwright&#8217;s
and would in all probability be a friend of
the lieutenant&#8217;s. Not for all that he owned in the
world or hoped to own, would he have thus laid
himself open to the possibility of having Wainwright
know any of his inner thoughts. He would
rather have lived and died unknown, unfriended,
than that this should come to pass.
</p>
<p>And she? The promised wife of Wainwright!
Could it be? She must have written him that letter
merely from a fine friendly patronage. All right,
of course, from her standpoint, but from his, gall
and wormwood to his proud spirit. Oh, that he had
not answered it! He might have known! He
should have remembered that she had never been
in his class. Not that his people were not as good
as hers, and maybe better, so far as intellectual
attainments were concerned; but his had lost their
money, had lived a quiet life, and in her eyes and
the eyes of her family were very likely as the mere
dust of the earth. And now, just now when war
had set its seal of sacrifice upon all young men in
uniform, he as a soldier had risen to a kind of
deified class set apart for hero worship, nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
more. It was not her fault that she had been
brought up that way, and that he seemed so to her,
and nothing more. She had shown her beautiful
spirit in giving him the tribute that seemed worthiest
to her view. He would not blame her, nor
despise her, but he would hold himself aloof as he
had done in the past, and show her that he wanted
no favors, no patronage. He was sufficient to himself.
What galled him most was to think that perhaps
in the intimacy of their engagement she might
show his letter to Wainwright, and they would laugh
together over him, a poor soldier, presuming to
write as he had done to a girl in her station. They
would laugh together, half pitifully&mdash;at least the
woman would be pitiful, the man was likely to sneer.
He could see his hateful mustache curl now with
scorn and his little eyes twinkle. And he would
tell her all the lies he had tried to put upon him in
the past. He would give her a wrong idea of his
character. He would rejoice and triumph to do so!
Oh, the bitterness of it! It overwhelmed him so
that the little matter of getting into his bunk without
being seen by the officer in charge was utterly
overlooked by him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Perhaps some good angel arranged the way for
him so that he was able to slip past the guards without
being challenged. Two of the guards were talking
at the corner of the barracks with their backs to
him at the particular second when he came in sight.
A minute later they turned back to their monotonous
march and the shadow of the vanishing corporal
had just disappeared from among the other dark
shadows of the night landscape. Inside the barracks
another guard welcomed him eagerly without
questioning his presence there at that hour:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Cam, how about day after to-morrow?
Are you free? Will you take my place on guard?
I want to go up to Philadelphia and see my girl,
and I&#8217;m sure of a pass, but I&#8217;m listed for guard
duty. I&#8217;ll do the same for you sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Cameron heartily, and swung up
stairs with a sudden realization that he had been
granted a streak of good luck. Yet somehow he
did not seem to care much.
</p>
<p>He tiptoed over to his bunk among the rows of
sleeping forms, removed from it a pair of shoes,
three books, some newspapers and a mess kit which
some lazy comrades had left there, and threw himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
down with scant undressing. It seemed as
though a great calamity had befallen him, although
when he tried to reason it out he could not understand
how things were so much changed from what
they had been that morning before he received the
letter. Ruth Macdonald had never been anything
in his life but a lovely picture. There was no slightest
possibility that she would ever be more. She
was like a distant star to be admired but never come
near. Had he been fool enough to have his head
turned by her writing that kind letter to him? Had
he even remotely fancied she would ever be anything
nearer to him than just a formal friend who
occasionally stooped to give a bright smile or do a
kindness? Well, if he had, he needed this knockdown
blow. It might be a good thing that it came
so soon before he had let this thing grow in his
imagination; but oh, if it had but come a bit sooner!
If it had only been on the way over to the Y.M.C.A.
hut instead of on the way back that letter would
never have been written! She would have set him
down as a boor perhaps, but what matter? What
was she to him, or he to her? Well&mdash;perhaps he
would have written a letter briefly to thank her for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
her offer of knitting, but it would have been an
entirely different letter from the one he did write.
He ground his teeth as he thought out the letter he
should have written:
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Miss Macdonald</span>: (No &#8220;friend&#8221; about that.)
</p>
<p>It certainly was kind of you to think of me as a possible
recipient of a sweater. But I feel that there are other boys
who perhaps need things more than I do. I am well supplied
with all necessities. I appreciate your interest in an old school
friend. The life of a soldier is not so bad, and I imagine we
shall have no end of novel experiences before the war is over.
I hope we shall be able to put an end to this terrible struggle
very soon when we get over and make the world a safe and
happy place for you and your friends. Here&#8217;s hoping the
men who are your special friends will all come home safe and
sound and soon.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right;  margin-right:8em;'>Sincerely,</p>
</div>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. Cameron</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>He wrote that letter over and over mentally as
he tossed on his bunk in the dark, changing phrases
and whole sentences. Perhaps it would be better to
say something about &#8220;her officer friends&#8221; and make
it very clear to her that he understood his own distant
position with her. Then suddenly he kicked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the big blue blanket off and sat up with a deep sigh.
What a fool he was. He could not write another
letter. The letter was gone, and as it was written
he must abide by it. He could not get it back or
unwrite it much as he wished it. There was no
excuse, or way to make it possible to write and
refuse those sweaters and things, was there?
</p>
<p>He sat staring into the darkness while the man
in the next bunk roused to toss back his blanket
which had fallen superfluously across his face, and
to mutter some sleepy imprecations. But Cameron
was off on the composition of another letter:
</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Miss Macdonald</span>:
</p>
<p>I have been thinking it over and have decided that I do not
need a sweater or any of those other things you mention. I
really am pretty well supplied with necessities, and you know
they don&#8217;t give us much room to put anything around the barracks.
There must be a lot of other fellows who need them
more, so I will decline that you may give your work to others
who have nothing, or to those who are your personal friends.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right;  margin-right:8em;'>Very truly,</p>
</div>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. Cameron</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Having convinced his turbulent brain that it
was quite possible for him to write such a letter as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
this, he flung himself miserably back on his hard cot
again and realized that he did not want to write it.
That it would be almost an insult to the girl, who
even if she had been patronizing him, had done it
with a kind intent, and after all it was not her fault
that he was a fool. She had a right to marry whom
she would. Certainly he never expected her to
marry him. Only he had to own to himself that he
wanted those things she had offered. He wanted to
touch something she had worked upon, and feel that
it belonged to him. He wanted to keep this much
of human friendship for himself. Even if she was
going to marry another man, she had always been
his ideal of a beautiful, lovable woman, and as such
she should stay his, even if she married a dozen
enemy officers!
</p>
<p>It was then he began to see that the thing that
was really making him miserable was that she was
giving her sweet young life to such a rotten little
mean-natured man as Wainwright. That was the
real pain. If some fine noble man like&mdash;well&mdash;like
Captain La Rue, only younger, of course, should
come along he would be glad for her. But this
excuse for a man! Oh, it was outrageous! How
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
could she be so deceived? and yet, of course,
women knew very little of men. They had no
standards by which to judge them. They had no
opportunity to see them except in plain sight of
those they wished to please. One could not expect
them to have discernment in selecting their friends.
But what a pity! Things were all wrong! There
ought to be some way to educate a woman so that
she would realize the dangers all about her and be
somewhat protected. It was worse for Ruth Macdonald
because she had no men in her family who
could protect her. Her old grandfather was the
only near living male relative and he was a hopeless
invalid, almost entirely confined to the house.
What could he know of the young men who came
to court his granddaughter? What did he remember
of the ways of men, having been so many years
shut away from their haunts?
</p>
<p>The corporal tossed on his hard cot and sighed
like a furnace. There ought to be some one to protect
her. Someone ought to make her understand
what kind of a fellow Wainwright was! She had
called him her knight, and a knight&#8217;s business was
to protect, yet what could he do? He could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
go to her and tell her that the man she was going to
marry was rotten and utterly without moral principle.
He could not even send some one else to
warn her. Who could he send? His mother? No,
his mother would feel shy and afraid of a girl like
that. She had always lived a quiet life. He doubted
if she would understand herself how utterly unfit
a mate Wainwright was for a good pure girl. And
there was no one else in the world that he could send.
Besides, if she loved the man, and incomprehensible
as it seemed, she must love him or why should she
marry him?&mdash;if she loved him she would not believe
an angel from heaven against him. Women were
that way; that is, if they were good women, like
Ruth. Oh, to think of her tied up to that&mdash;<i>beast!</i>
He could think of no other word. In his
agony he rolled on his face and groaned aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh God!&#8221; his soul cried out, &#8220;why do such
things have to be? If there really is a God why
does He let such awful things happen to a pure
good girl? The same old bitter question that had
troubled the hard young days of his own life. Could
there be a God who cared when bitterness was in so
many cups? Why had God let the war come?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Sometime in the night the tumult in his brain
and heart subsided and he fell into a profound sleep.
The next thing he knew the kindly roughness of his
comrades wakened him with shakes and wet sponges
flying through the air, and he opened his consciousness
to the world again and heard the bugle blowing
for roll call. Another day had dawned grayly and
he must get up. They set him on his feet, and
bantered him into action, and he responded with
his usual wit that put them all in howls of laughter,
but as he stumbled into place in the line in the five
o&#8217;clock dawning he realized that a heavy weight was
on his heart which he tried to throw off. What did
it matter what Ruth Macdonald did with her life?
She was nothing to him, never had been and never
could be. If only he had not written that letter all
would now be as it always had been. If only she
had not written her letter! Or no! He put his
hand to his breast pocket with a quick movement of
protection. Somehow he was not yet ready to relinquish
that one taste of bright girl friendliness,
even though it had brought a stab in its wake.
</p>
<p>He was glad when the orders came for him and
five other fellows to tramp across the camp to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
gas school and go through two solid hours of instruction
ending with a practical illustration of the
gas mask and a good dose of gas. It helped to put
his mind on the great business of war which was to
be his only business now until it or he were ended.
He set his lips grimly and went about his work
vigorously. What did it matter, anyway, what she
thought of him? He need never answer another
letter, even if she wrote. He need not accept the
package from the post office. He could let them
send it back&mdash;refuse it and let them send it back,
that was what he could do! Then she might think
what she liked. Perhaps she would suppose him
already gone to France. Anyhow, he would forget
her! It was the only sensible thing to do.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the letter had flown on its way with
more than ordinary swiftness, as if it had known
that a force was seeking to bring it back again. The
Y.M.C.A. man was carried at high speed in an
automobile to the nearest station to the camp, and
arrived in time to catch the Baltimore train just
stopping. In the Baltimore station he went to
mail the letter just as the letter gatherer arrived
with his keys to open the box. So the letter lost no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
time but was sorted and started northward before
midnight, and by some happy chance arrived at its
destination in time to be laid by Ruth Macdonald&#8217;s
plate at lunch time the next day.
</p>
<p>Some quick sense must have warned Ruth, for
she gathered her mail up and slipped it unobtrusively
into the pocket of her skirt before it could be
noticed. Dottie Wetherill had come home with her
for lunch and the bright red Y.M.C.A. triangle on
the envelope was so conspicuous. Dottie was crazy
over soldiers and all things military. She would be
sure to exclaim and ask questions. She was one of
those people who always found out everything about
you that you did not keep under absolute lock
and key.
</p>
<p>Every day since she had written her letter to
Cameron Ruth had watched for an answer, her
cheeks glowing sometimes with the least bit of
mortification that she should have written at all to
have received this rebuff. Had he, after all, misunderstood
her? Or had the letter gone astray, or
the man gone to the front? She had almost given
up expecting an answer now after so many weeks,
and the nice warm olive-drab sweater and neatly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
knitted socks with extra long legs and bright lines
of color at the top, with the wristlets and muffler lay
wrapped in tissue paper at the very bottom of a
drawer in the chiffonier where she would seldom
see it and where no one else would ever find it and
question her. Probably by and by when the colored
draftees were sent away she would get them out
and carry them down to the headquarters to be
given to some needy man. She felt humiliated and
was beginning to tell herself that it was all her own
fault and a good lesson for her. She had even decided
not to go and see John Cameron&#8217;s mother
again lest that, too, might be misunderstood. It
seemed that the frank true instincts of her own
heart had been wrong, and she was getting what
she justly deserved for departing from Aunt
Rhoda&#8217;s strictly conventional code.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the letter in her pocket which she
had not been able to look at carefully enough to be
sure if she knew the writing, crackled and rustled
and set her heart beating excitedly, and her mind
to wondering what it might be. She answered
Dottie Wetherill&#8217;s chatter with distraught monosyllables
and absent smiles, hoping that Dottie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
would feel it necessary to go home soon after lunch.
</p>
<p>But it presently became plain that Dottie had no
intention of going home soon; that she had come for
a purpose and that she was plying all her arts to
accomplish it. Ruth presently roused from her
reverie to realize this and set herself to give Dottie
as little satisfaction as possible out of her task. It
was evident that she had been sent to discover the
exact standing and relation in which Ruth held
Lieutenant Harry Wainwright. Ruth strongly
suspected that Dottie&#8217;s brother Bob had been the
instigator of the mission, and she had no intention
of giving him the information.
</p>
<p>So Ruth&#8217;s smiles came out and the inscrutable
twinkle grew in her lovely eyes. Dottie chattered
on sentence after sentence, paragraph after paragraph,
theme after theme, always rounding up at
the end with some perfectly obvious leading question.
Ruth answered in all apparent innocence and
sincerity, yet with an utterly different turn of the
conversation from what had been expected, and
with an indifference that was hopelessly baffling
unless the young ambassador asked a point blank
question, which she hardly dared to do of Ruth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Macdonald without more encouragement. And so
at last a long two hours dragged thus away, and
finally Dottie Wetherill at the end of her small
string, and at a loss for more themes on which to
trot around again to the main idea, reluctantly
accepted her defeat and took herself away, leaving
Ruth to her long delayed letter.

<h2>VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth sat looking into space with starry eyes and
glowing cheeks after she had read the letter. It
seemed to her a wonderful letter, quite the most
wonderful she had ever received. Perhaps it was
because it fitted so perfectly with her ideal of the
writer, who from her little girlhood had always been
a picture of what a hero must be. She used to
dream big things about him when she was a child.
He had been the best baseball player in school when
he was ten, and the handsomest little rowdy in
town, as well as the boldest, bravest champion of
the little girls.
</p>
<p>As she grew older and met him occasionally she
had always been glad that he kept his old hero look
though often appearing in rough garb. She had
known they were poor. There had been some story
about a loss of money and a long expensive sickness
of the father&#8217;s following an accident which
made all the circumstances most trying, but she
had never heard the details. She only knew that
most of the girls in her set looked on him as a nobody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and would no more have companied with him than
with their father&#8217;s chauffeur. After he grew older
and began to go to college some of the girls began
to think he was good looking, and to say it was
quite commendable in him to try to get an education.
Some even unearthed the fact that his had
been a fine old family in former days and that there
had been wealth and servants once. But the story
died down as John Cameron walked his quiet way
apart, keeping to his old friends, and not responding
to the feeble advances of the girls. Ruth had
been away at school in these days and had seldom
seen him. When she had there had always been
that lingering admiration for him from the old days.
She had told herself that of course he could not be
worth much or people would know him. He was
probably ignorant and uncultured, and a closer
acquaintance would show him far from what her
young ideas had pictured her hero. But somehow
that day at the station, the look in his face had revealed
fine feeling, and she was glad now to have
her intuition concerning him verified by his letter.
</p>
<p>And what a letter it was! Why, no young man
of her acquaintance could have written with such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
poetic delicacy. That paragraph about the rose was
beautiful, and not a bit too presuming, either, in one
who had been a perfect stranger all these years.
She liked his simple frankness and the easy way he
went back twelve years and began just where they
left off. There was none of the bold forwardness
that might have been expected in one who had not
moved in cultured society. There was no unpleasant
assumption of familiarity which might have
emphasized her fear that she had overstepped the
bounds of convention in writing to him in the first
place. On the contrary, her humiliation at his long
delayed answer was all forgotten now. He had
understood her perfectly and accepted her letter in
exactly the way she had meant it without the least
bit of foolishness or unpleasantness. In short, he
had written the sort of a letter that the kind of man
she had always thought&mdash;hoped&mdash;he was would be
likely to write, and it gave her a surprisingly pleasant
feeling of satisfaction. It was as if she had
discovered a friend all of her own not made for her
by her family, nor one to whom she fell heir because
of her wealth and position; but just one she
had found, out in the great world of souls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>If he had been going to remain at home there
might have been a number of questions, social and
conventional, which would have arisen to bar the
way to this free feeling of a friendship, and which
she would have had to meet and reason with before
her mind would have shaken itself unhampered;
but because he was going away and on such an
errand, perhaps never to return, the matter of what
her friends might think or what the world would
say, simply did not enter into the question at all.
The war had lifted them both above such ephemeral
barriers into the place of vision where a soul
was a soul no matter what he possessed or who he
was. So, as she sat in her big white room with all
its dainty accessories to a luxurious life, fit setting
for a girl so lovely, she smiled unhindered at this
bit of beautiful friendship that had suddenly drifted
down at her feet out of a great outside unknown
world. She touched the letter thoughtfully with
caressing fingers, and the kind of a high look in her
eyes that a lady of old must have worn when she
thought of her knight. It came to her to wonder
that she had not felt so about any other of her men
friends who had gone into the service. Why should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
this special one soldier boy represent the whole war,
as it were, in this way to her. However, it was but
a passing thought, and with a smile still upon her
lips she went to the drawer and brought out the
finely knitted garments she had made, wrapping
them up with care and sending them at once upon
their way. It somehow gave her pleasure to set
aside a small engagement she had for that afternoon
until she had posted the package herself.
</p>
<p>Even then, when she took her belated way to a
little gathering in honor of one of her girl friends
who was going to be married the next week to a
young aviator, she kept the smile on her lips and
the dreamy look in her eyes, and now and then
brought herself back from the chatter around her
to remember that something pleasant had happened.
Not that there was any foolishness in her thoughts.
There was too much dignity and simplicity about
the girl, young as she was, to allow her to deal even
with her own thoughts in any but a maidenly way,
and it was not in the ordinary way of a maid with a
man that she thought of this young soldier. He was
so far removed from her life in every way, and all
the well-drilled formalities, that it never occurred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
to her to think of him in the same way she thought
of her other men friends.
</p>
<p>A friend who understood her, and whom she
could understand. That was what she had always
wanted and what she had never quite had with any
of her young associates. One or two had approached
to that, but always there had been a point
at which they had fallen short. That she should
make this man her friend whose letter crackled in
her pocket, in that intimate sense of the word, did
not occur to her even now. He was somehow set
apart for service in her mind; and as such she had
chosen him to be her special knight, she to be the
lady to whom he might look for encouragement&mdash;whose
honor he was going forth to defend. It was
a misty dreamy ideal of a thought. Somehow she
would not have picked out any other of her boy
friends to be a knight for her. They were too flippant,
too careless and light hearted. The very way
in which they lighted their multitudinous cigarettes
and flipped the match away gave impression that
they were going to have the time of their lives in
this war. They might have patriotism down at the
bottom of all this froth and boasting, doubtless they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
had; but there was so little seriousness about them
that one would never think of them as knights, defenders
of some great cause of righteousness. Perhaps
she was all wrong. Perhaps it was only her
old baby fancy for the little boy who could always
&#8220;lick&#8221; the other boys and save the girls from
trouble that prejudiced her in his favor, but at least
it was pleasant and a great relief to know that her
impulsive letter had not been misunderstood.
</p>
<p>The girls prattled of this one and that who were
&#8220;going over&#8221; soon, told of engagements and marriages
soon to occur; criticized the brides and
grooms to be; declared their undying opinions about
what was fitting for a war bride to wear; and
whether they would like to marry a man who had
to go right into war and might return minus an arm
or an eye. They discoursed about the U-boats with
a frothy cheerfulness that made Ruth shudder; and
in the same breath told what nice eyes a young captain
had who had recently visited the town, and
what perfectly lovely uniforms he wore. They
argued with serious zeal whether a girl should wear
an olive-drab suit this year if she wanted to look
really smart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>They were the girls among whom she had been
brought up, and Ruth was used to their froth, but
somehow to-day it bored her beyond expression.
She was glad to make an excuse to get away and
she drove her little car around by the way of John
Cameron&#8217;s home hoping perhaps to get a glimpse of
his mother again. But the house had a shut up
look behind the vine that he had trained, as if it
were lonely and lying back in a long wait till he
should come&mdash;or not come! A pang went through
her heart. For the first time she thought what it
meant for a young life like that to be silenced by
cold steel. The home empty! The mother alone!
His ambitions and hopes unfulfilled! It came to
her, too, that if he were her knight he might have
to die for her&mdash;for his cause! She shuddered and
swept the unpleasant thought away, but it had left
its mark and would return again.
</p>
<p>On the way back she passed a number of young
soldiers home on twenty-four hour leave from the
nearby camps. They saluted most eagerly, and she
knew that any one of them would have gladly
occupied the vacant seat in her car, but she was
not in the mood to talk with them. She felt that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
there was something to be thought out and fixed in
her mind, some impression that life had for her that
afternoon that she did not want to lose in the mild
fritter of gay banter that would be sure to follow
if she stopped and took home some of the boys. So
she bowed graciously and swept by at a high speed
as if in a great hurry. The war! The war! It was
beating itself into her brain again in much the same
way it had done on that morning when the drafted
men went away, only now it had taken on a more
personal touch. She kept seeing the lonely vine-clad
house where that one soldier had lived, and
which he had left so desolate. She kept thinking
how many such homes and mothers there must be in
the land.
</p>
<p>That evening when she was free to go to her
room she read John Cameron&#8217;s letter again, and
then, feeling almost as if she were childish in her
haste, she sat down and wrote an answer. Somehow
that second reading made her feel his wish for
an answer. It seemed a mute appeal that she
could not resist.
</p>
<p>When John Cameron received that letter and
the accompanying package he was lifted into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
seventh heaven for a little while. He forgot all his
misgivings, he even forgot Lieutenant Wainwright
who had but that day become a most formidable foe,
having been transferred to Cameron&#8217;s company,
where he was liable to be commanding officer in
absence of the captain, and where frequent salutes
would be inevitable. It had been a terrible blow
to Cameron. But now it suddenly seemed a small
matter. He put on his new sweater and swelled
around the way the other boys did, letting them all
admire him. He examined the wonderful socks
almost reverently, putting a large curious finger
gently on the red and blue stripes and thrilling with
the thought that her fingers had plied the needles in
those many, many stitches to make them. He almost
felt it would be sacrilege to wear them, and he laid
them away most carefully and locked them into the
box under his bed lest some other fellow should
admire and desire them to his loss. But with the
letter he walked away into the woods as far as the
bounds of the camp would allow and read and reread
it, rising at last from it as one refreshed from
a comforting meal after long fasting. It was on
the way back to his barracks that night, walking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
slowly under the starlight, not desiring to be back
until the last minute before night taps because he
did not wish to break the wonderful evening he had
spent with her, that he resolved to try to get leave
the next Saturday and go home to thank her.
</p>
<p>Back in the barracks with the others he fairly
scintillated with wit and kept his comrades in roars
of laughter until the officer of the night suppressed
them summarily. But long after the others were
asleep he lay thinking of her, and listening to the
singing of his soul as he watched a star that twinkled
with a friendly gleam through a crack in the roof
above his cot. Once again there came the thought
of God, and a feeling of gratitude for this lovely
friendship in his life. If he knew where God was
he would like to thank Him. Lying so and looking
up to the star he breathed from his heart a
wordless thanksgiving.
</p>
<p>The next night he wrote and told her he was
coming, and asked permission to call and thank her
face to face. Then he fairly haunted the post office
at mail time the rest of the week hoping for an
answer. He had not written his mother about his
coming, for he meant not to go this week if there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
came no word from Ruth. Besides, it would be nice
to surprise his mother. Then there was some doubt
about his getting a pass anyway, and so between the
two anxieties he was kept busy up to the last minute.
But Friday evening he got his pass, and in the last
mail came a special delivery from Ruth, just a brief
note saying she had been away from home when
his letter arrived, but she would be delighted to see
him on Sunday afternoon as he had suggested.
</p>
<p>He felt like a boy let loose from school as he
brushed up his uniform and polished his big army
shoes while his less fortunate companions kidded
him about the girl he was going to see. He denied
their thrusts joyously, in his heart repudiating any
such personalities, yet somehow it was pleasant. He
had never realized how pleasant it would be to
have a girl and be going to see her&mdash;such a girl!
Of course, she was not for him&mdash;not with that possessiveness.
But she was a friend, a real friend,
and he would not let anything spoil the pleasure
of that!
</p>
<p>He had not thought anything in his army experience
could be so exciting as that first ride back
home again. Somehow the deference paid to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
uniform got into his blood and made him feel that
people all along the line really did care for what
the boys were doing for them. It made camp life
and hardships seem less dreary.
</p>
<p>It was great to get back to his little mother and
put his big arms around her again. She seemed so
small. Had she shrunken since he left her or was
he grown so much huskier with the out of door life?
Both, perhaps, and he looked at her sorrowfully.
She was so little and quiet and brave to bear life all
alone. If he only could get back and get to succeeding
in life so that he might make some brightness
for her. She had borne so much, and she ought
not to have looked so old and worn at her age! For
a brief instant again his heart was almost bitter, and
he wondered what God meant by giving his good
little mother so much trouble. Was there a God
when such things could be? He resolved to do something
about finding out this very day.
</p>
<p>It was pleasant to help his mother about the
kitchen, saving her as she had not been saved since
he left, telling her about the camp, and listening to
her tearful admiration of him. She could scarcely
take her eyes from him, he seemed so tall and big
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
and handsome in his uniform; he appeared so much
older and more manly that her heart yearned for
her boy who seemed to be slipping away from her.
It was so heavenly blessed to sit down beside him
and sew on a button and mend a torn spot in his
flannel shirt and have him pat her shoulder now and
then contentedly.
</p>
<p>Then with pride she sent him down to the store
for something nice for dinner, and watched him
through the window with a smile, the tears running
down her cheeks. How tall and straight he
walked! How like his father when she first knew
him! She hoped the neighbors all were looking out
and would see him. Her boy! Her soldier boy!
And he must go away from her, perhaps to die!
</p>
<p>But&mdash;<i>he was here to-day</i>! She would not think
of the rest. She would rejoice now in his presence.
</p>
<p>He walked briskly down the street past the
houses that had been familiar all his life, meeting
people who had never been wont to notice him before;
and they smiled upon him from afar now;
greeted him with enthusiasm, and turned to look
after him as he passed on. It gave him a curious
feeling to have so much attention from people who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
had never known him before. It made him feel
strangely small, yet filled with a great pride and
patriotism for the country that was his, and the
government which he now represented to them all.
He was something more to them now than just one
of the boys about town who had grown up among
them. He was a soldier of the United States. He
had given his life for the cause of righteousness.
The bitterness he might have felt at their former
ignoring of him, was all swallowed up in their
genuine and hearty friendliness.
</p>
<p>He met the white-haired minister, kindly and
dignified, who paused to ask him how he liked camp
life and to commend him as a soldier; and looking in
his strong gentle face John Cameron remembered
his resolve.
</p>
<p>He flashed a keen look at the gracious countenance
and made up his mind to speak:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask you a question, Doctor Thurlow.
It&#8217;s been bothering me quite a little ever since
this matter of going away to fight has been in my
mind. Is there any way that a man&mdash;that <i>I</i> can find
God? That is, if there is a God. I&#8217;ve never thought
much about it before, but life down there in camp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
makes a lot of things seem different, and I&#8217;ve been
wondering. I&#8217;m not sure what I believe. Is there
anyway I can find out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A pleasant gleam of surprise and delight
thrilled into the deep blue eyes of the minister. It
was startling. It almost embarrassed him for a
moment, it was so unexpected to have a soldier ask
a question about God. It was almost mortifying
that he had never thought it worth while to take
the initiative on that question with the young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly!&#8221; he said heartily. &#8220;Of
course, of course. I&#8217;m very glad to know you are
interested in those things. Couldn&#8217;t you come in
to my study and talk with me. I think I could help
you. I&#8217;m sure I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t much time,&#8221; said Cameron shyly,
half ashamed now that he had opened his heart to
an almost stranger. He was not even his mother&#8217;s
minister, and he was a comparative newcomer in
the town. How had he come to speak to him so
impulsively?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, exactly, of course,&#8221; said the
minister with growing eagerness. &#8220;Could you
come in now for five or ten minutes? I&#8217;ll turn back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
with you and you can stop on your way, or we
can talk as we go. Were you thinking of uniting
with the church? We have our communion the first
Sunday of next month. I should be very glad if
you could arrange. We have a number of young
people coming in now. I&#8217;d like to see you come
with them. The church is a good safe place to be.
It was established by God. It is a school in which
to learn of Him. It is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not what you would call a Christian!&#8221;
protested Cameron. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know that I believe
in the Bible. I don&#8217;t know what your church
believes. I don&#8217;t have a very definite idea what any
church believes. I would be a hypocrite to stand up
and join a church when I wasn&#8217;t sure there was
a God.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young fellow!&#8221; said the minister
affectionately. &#8220;Not at all! Not at all! The
church is the place for young people to come when
they have doubts. It is a shelter, and a growing
place. Just trust yourself to God and come in
among His people and your doubts will vanish.
Don&#8217;t worry about doubts. Many people have
doubts. Just let them alone and put yourself in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
right way and you will forget them. I should be
glad to talk with you further. I would like to see
you come into communion with God&#8217;s people. If
you want to find God you should come where He
has promised to be. It is a great thing to have a
fine young fellow like you, and a soldier, array himself
on the side of God. I would like to see you
stand up on the right side before you go out to
meet danger and perhaps death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Cameron stood watching him as he talked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good old guy,&#8221; he thought gravely,
&#8220;but he doesn&#8217;t get my point. He evidently believes
what he says, but I don&#8217;t just see going blindfolded
into a church. However, there&#8217;s something
to what he says about going where God is if I want
to find him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Out loud he merely said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it, Doctor, and perhaps come
in to see you the next time I&#8217;m home.&#8221; Then he
excused himself and went on to the store.
</p>
<p>As he walked away he said to himself:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Ruth Macdonald would say if
I asked her the same question? I wonder if she has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
thought anything about it? I wonder if I&#8217;d ever
have the nerve to ask her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next morning he suggested to his mother
that they go to Doctor Thurlow&#8217;s church together.
She would have very much preferred going to her
own church with him, but she knew that he did not
care for the minister and had never been very
friendly with the people, so she put aside her secret
wish and went with him. To tell the truth she was
very proud to go anywhere with her handsome soldier
son, and one thing that made her the more willing
was that she remembered that the Macdonalds
always went to the Presbyterian church, and perhaps
they would be there to-day and Ruth would
see them. But she said not a word of this to her boy.
</p>
<p>John spent most of the time with his mother.
He went up to college for an hour or so Saturday
evening, dropping in on his fraternity for a few
minutes and realizing what true friends he had
among the fellows who were left, though most of
them were gone. He walked about the familiar
rooms, looking at the new pictures, photographs of
his friends in uniform. This one was a lieutenant
in Officers&#8217; Training Camp. That one had gone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
with the Ambulance Corps. Tom was with the
Engineers, and Jimmie and Sam had joined the
Tank Service. Two of the fellows were in France
in the front ranks, another had enlisted in the
Marines, it seemed that hardly any were left, and
of those three had been turned down for some slight
physical defect, and were working in munition factories
and the ship-yard. Everything was changed.
The old playmates had become men with earnest
purposes. He did not stay long. There was a
restlessness about it all that pulled the strings of
his heart, and made him realize how different everything
was.
</p>
<p>Sunday morning as he walked to church with
his mother he wondered why he had never gone more
with her when he was at home. It seemed a pleasant
thing to do.
</p>
<p>The service was beautifully solemn, and Doctor
Thurlow had many gracious words to say of the
boys in the army, and spent much time reading letters
from those at the front who belonged to the
church and Sunday school, and spoke of the
&#8220;supreme sacrifice&#8221; in the light of a saving grace;
but the sermon was a gentle ponderous thing that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
got nowhere, spiced toward its close with thrilling
scenes from battle news. John Cameron as he
listened did not feel that he had found God. He
did not feel a bit enlightened by it. He laid it to
his own ignorance and stupidity, though, and determined
not to give up the search. The prayer at the
close of the sermon somehow clinched this resolve
because there was something so genuine and sweet
and earnest about it. He could not help thinking
that the man might know more of God than he was
able to make plain to his hearers. He had really
never noticed either a prayer or a sermon before in
his life. He had sat in the room with very few. He
wondered if all sermons and prayers were like these
and wished he had noticed them. He had never been
much of a church goer.
</p>
<p>But the climax, the real heart of his whole two
days, was after Sunday dinner when he went out to
call upon Ruth Macdonald. And it was characteristic
of his whole reticent nature, and the way he had
been brought up, that he did not tell his mother
where he was going. It had never occurred to him
to tell her his movements when they did not directly
concern her, and she had never brought herself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
up to ask him. It is the habit of some women,
and many mothers.
</p>
<p>A great embarrassment fell upon him as he
entered the grounds of the Macdonald place, and
when he stood before the plate-glass doors waiting
for an answer to his ring he would have turned and
fled if he had not promised to come.
</p>
<p>It was perhaps not an accident that Ruth let
him in herself and took him to a big quiet library
with wide-open windows overlooking the lawn, and
heavy curtains shutting them in from the rest of
the house, where, to his great amazement, he could
feel at once at ease with her and talk to her just as
he had done in her letters and his own.
</p>
<p>Somehow it was like having a lifetime dream
suddenly fulfilled to be sitting this way in pleasant
converse with her, watching the lights and shadows
of expression flit across her sensitive face, and knowing
that the light in her eyes was for him. It seemed
incredible, but she evidently enjoyed talking to him.
Afterwards he thought about it as if their souls had
been calling to one another across infinite space,
things that neither of them could quite hear, and
now they were within hailing distance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>He had thanked her for the sweater and other
things, and they had talked a little about the old
school days and how life changed people, when he
happened to glance out of the window near him
and saw a man in officer&#8217;s uniform approaching.
He stopped short in the midst of a sentence and
rose, his face set, his eyes still on the rapidly approaching
soldiers:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall have to go. It&#8217;s
been wonderful to come, but I must go at once.
Perhaps you&#8217;ll let me go out this way. It is a
shorter cut. Thank you for everything, and perhaps
if there&#8217;s ever another time&mdash;I&#8217;d like to come
again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t go yet!&#8221; she said putting out
her hand in protest. But he grasped the hand with
a quick impulsive grip and with a hasty: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,
but I must!&#8221; he opened the glass door to the side
piazza and was gone.
</p>
<p>In much bewilderment and distress Ruth
watched him stride away toward the hedge and disappear.
Then she turned to the front window and
caught a glimpse of Lieutenant Wainwright just
mounting the front steps. What did it all mean?
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
<h2>IX</h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth tried to control her perturbation and
meet her guest with an unruffled countenance, but
there was something about the bland smug countenance
of Lieutenant Wainwright that irritated her.
To have her first pleasant visit with Cameron suddenly
broken up in this mysterious fashion, and
Wainwright substituted for Cameron was somehow
like taking a bite of some pleasant fruit and having
it turn out plain potato in one&#8217;s mouth. It was so
sudden, like that. She could not seem to get her
equilibrium. Her mind was in a whirl of question
and she could not focus it on her present caller nor
think of anything suitable to say to him. She was
not even sure but that he was noticing that she
was distraught.
</p>
<p>To have John Cameron leave in that precipitate
manner at the sight of Harry Wainwright! It was
all too evident that he had seen him through the window.
But they were fellow townsmen, and had
gone to school together! Surely he knew him! Of
course, Harry was a superior officer, but Cameron
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
would not be the kind of man to mind that. She
could not understand it. There had been a look in
his face&mdash;a set look! There must be something
behind it all. Some reason why he did not want
to be seen by Wainwright. Surely Cameron had
nothing of which to be ashamed! The thought
brought a sudden dismay. What did she know
about Cameron after all? A look, a smile, a bit of
boyish gallantry. He might be anything but fine
in his private life, of course, and Harry might be
cognizant of the fact. Yet he did not look like that.
Even while the thought forced itself into her mind
she resented it and resisted it. Then turning to her
guest who was giving an elaborate account of how
he had saved a woman&#8217;s life in an automobile accident,
she interrupted him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry, what do you know about John Cameron?&#8221;
she asked impulsively.
</p>
<p>Wainwright&#8217;s face darkened with an ugly frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More than I want to know,&#8221; he answered
gruffly. &#8220;He&#8217;s rotten! That&#8217;s all! Why?&#8221; He
eyed her suspiciously.
</p>
<p>There was something in his tone that put her on
the defensive at once:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I saw him to-day, and I was wondering,&#8221;
she answered evasively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the annoyances of army life that
we have to be herded up with all sorts of cattle!&#8221;
said Wainwright with a disdainful curl of his baby
mustache. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t come here to talk about
John Cameron. I came to tell you that I&#8217;m going
to be married, Ruth. I&#8217;m going to be married before
I go to France!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delightful!&#8221; said Ruth pleasantly. &#8220;Do I
know the lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you do,&#8221; he said watching her with satisfaction.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve known, for several years that
you were the only one for me, and I&#8217;ve come to tell
you that I won&#8217;t stand any more dallying. I mean
business now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He crossed his fat leather puttees creakily and
swelled out, trying to look firm. He had decided
that he must impress her with the seriousness of
the occasion.
</p>
<p>But Ruth only laughed merrily. He had been
proposing to her ever since he got out of short
trousers, and she had always laughed him out of it.
The first time she told him that she was only a kid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
and he wasn&#8217;t much more himself, and she didn&#8217;t
want to hear any more such talk. Of late he had
grown less troublesome, and she had been inclined
to settle down to the old neighborly playmate relation,
so she was not greatly disturbed by the turn
of the conversation. In fact, she was too much
upset and annoyed by the sudden departure
of Cameron to realize the determined note in
Wainwright&#8217;s voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it!&#8221; he said in an offended tone, flattening
his double chin and rolling out his fat
lips importantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not to be played with
any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s face sobered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly never had an idea of playing with
you, Harry. I think I&#8217;ve always been quite frank
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wainwright felt that he wasn&#8217;t getting on quite
as well as he had planned. He frowned and sat up:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Ruth! Let&#8217;s talk this thing
over!&#8221; he said, drawing the big leather chair in
which he was sitting nearer to hers.
</p>
<p>But Ruth&#8217;s glance had wandered out of the window.
&#8220;Why, there comes Bobbie Wetherill!&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
exclaimed eagerly and slipped out of her chair to
the door just as one of Wainwright&#8217;s smooth fat
hands reached out to take hold of the arm of her
rocker. &#8220;I&#8217;ll open the door for him. Mary is in
the kitchen and may not hear the bell right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was nothing for Wainwright to do but
make the best of the situation, although he greeted
Wetherill with no very good grace, and his large
lips pouted out sulkily as he relaxed into his chair
again to await the departure of the intruder.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Wetherill was quite overwhelmed
with the warmth of the greeting he received from
Ruth and settled down to enjoy it while it lasted.
With a wicked glance of triumph at his rival he laid
himself out to make his account of camp life as entertaining
as possible. He produced a gorgeous box
of bonbons and arranged himself comfortably for
the afternoon, while Wainwright&#8217;s brow grew
darker and his lips pouted out farther and farther
under his petted little moustache. It was all a
great bore to Ruth just now with her mind full of
the annoyance about Cameron. At least she would
have preferred to have had her talk with him and
found out what he was with her own judgment. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
anything was better than, a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Wainwright
just now; so she ate bonbons and asked questions,
and kept the conversation going, ignoring
Wainwright&#8217;s increasing grouch.
</p>
<p>It was a great relief, however, when about half-past
four the maid appeared at the door:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A long distance telephone call for you,
Miss Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Ruth was going up the stairs to her own
private &#8217;phone she paused to fasten the tie of her low
shoe that had come undone and was threatening to
trip her, and she heard Harry Wainwright&#8217;s voice in
an angry snarl:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What business did you have coming here to-day,
you darned chump! You knew what I came
for, and you did it on purpose! If you don&#8217;t get out
the minute she gets back I&#8217;ll put her wise to you and
the kind of girls you go with in no time. And you
needn&#8217;t think you can turn the tables on me, either,
for I&#8217;ll fix you so you won&#8217;t dare open your
fool mouth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sentence finished with an oath and Ruth
hurried into her room and shut the door with a sick
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
kind of feeling that her whole little world was turning
black about her.
</p>
<p>It was good to hear the voice of her cousin, Captain
La Rue, over the &#8217;phone, even though it was
but a message that he could not come as he had
promised that evening. It reassured her that there
were good men in the world. Of course, he was
older, but she was sure he had never been what
people called &#8220;wild,&#8221; although he had plenty of
courage and spirit. She had often heard that good
men were few, but it had never seemed to apply to
her world but vaguely. Now here of a sudden a
slur had been thrown at three of her young world.
John Cameron, it is true, was a comparative
stranger, and, of course, she had no means of judging
except by the look in his eyes. She understood
in a general way that &#8220;rotten&#8221; as applied to a
young man&#8217;s character implied uncleanness. John
Cameron&#8217;s eyes were steady and clear. They did
not look that way. But then, how could she tell?
And here, this very minute she had been hearing
that Bobbie Wetherill&#8217;s life was not all that
it should be and Wainwright had tacitly accepted
the possibility of the same weakness in himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
These were boys with whom she had been brought
up. Selfish and conceited she had often thought
them on occasion, but it had not occurred to her that
there might be anything worse. She pressed her
hands to her eyes and tried to force a calm steadiness
into her soul. Somehow she had an utter distaste
for going back into that library and hearing
their boastful chatter. Yet she must go. She
had been hoping all the afternoon for her cousin&#8217;s
arrival to send the other two away. Now that was
out of the question and she must use her own tact to
get pleasantly rid of them. With a sigh she opened
her door and started down stairs again.
</p>
<p>It was Wainwright&#8217;s blatant voice again that
broke through the Sabbath afternoon stillness of
the house as she approached the library door:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got John Cameron all right now!&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;He won&#8217;t hold his head so high after
he&#8217;s spent a few days in the guard-house. And
that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re all going to get that are late coming
back this time. I found out before I left camp
that his pass only reads till eleven o&#8217;clock and the
five o&#8217;clock train is the last one he can leave Chester
on to get him to camp by eleven. So I hired a fellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
that was coming up to buddy-up to Cam and fix it
that he is to get a friend of his to take them over to
Chester in time for the train. The fellow don&#8217;t
have to get back himself to-night at all, but he isn&#8217;t
going to let on, you know, so Cam will think they&#8217;re
in the same boat. Then they&#8217;re going to have a little
bit of tire trouble, down in that lonely bit of rough
road, that short cut between here and Chester,
where there aren&#8217;t any cars passing to help them
out, and they&#8217;ll miss the train at Chester. See?
And then the man will offer to take them on to camp
in his car and they&#8217;ll get stuck again down beyond
Wilmington, lose the road, and switch off toward
Singleton&mdash;you know, where we took those girls to
that little out-of-the-way tavern that time&mdash;and you
see Cam getting back to camp in time, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth had paused with her hand on the heavy
portiere, wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Cameron&#8217;ll find a way out. He&#8217;s too
sharp. He&#8217;ll start to walk, or he&#8217;ll get some passing
car to take him,&#8221; said Wetherill with conviction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he won&#8217;t. The fellows are all primed.
They&#8217;re going to catch him in spots where cars don&#8217;t
go, where the road is bad, you know, and nobody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
but a fool would go with a car. He won&#8217;t be noticing
before they break down because this fellow told
him his man could drive a car over the moon and
never break down. Besides, I know my men.
They&#8217;ll get away with the job. There&#8217;s too much
money in it for them to run any risk of losing out.
It&#8217;s all going to happen so quick he won&#8217;t be ready
for anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have your trouble for your pains.
Cam&#8217;ll explain everything to the officers and he&#8217;ll
get by. He always does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this time. They&#8217;ve just made a rule that
no excuses go. There&#8217;ve been a lot of fellows coming
back late drunk. And you see that&#8217;s how we mean
to wind up. They are going to get him drunk, and
then we&#8217;ll see if little Johnnie will go around with
his nose in the air any longer! I&#8217;m going to run
down to the tavern late this evening to see the
fun my self!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it! Cam won&#8217;t drink! It&#8217;s been
tried again and again. He&#8217;d rather die!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the girl at the door had fled to her room
on velvet shod feet and closed her door, her face
white with horror, her lips set with purpose, her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
heart beating wildly. She must put a stop somehow
to this diabolical plot against him. Whether
he was worthy or not they should not do this thing
to him! She rang for the maid and began putting
on her hat and coat and flinging a few things into a
small bag. She glanced at her watch. It was a
quarter to five. Could she make it? If she only
knew which way he had gone! Would his mother
have a telephone? Her eyes scanned the C column
hurriedly. Yes, there it was. She might have
known he would not allow her to be alone without
a telephone.
</p>
<p>The maid appeared at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; she said, trying to speak calmly, &#8220;tell
Thomas to have the gray car ready at once. He
needn&#8217;t bring it to the house, I will come out the
back way. Please take this bag and two long coats
out, and when I am gone go to the library and ask
the two gentlemen there to excuse me. Say that I
am suddenly called away to a friend in trouble. If
Aunt Rhoda returns soon tell her I will call her
up later and let her know my plans. That is all. I
will be down in two or three minutes and I wish to
start without delay!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>Mary departed on her errand and Ruth went to
the telephone and called up the Cameron number.
</p>
<p>The sadness of the answering voice struck her
even in her haste. Her own tone was eager, intimate,
as she hastened to convey her message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Cameron, this is Ruth Macdonald. Has
your son left yet? I was wondering if he would
care to be taken to the train in our car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he has <i>just gone</i>!&#8221; came a pitiful little
gasp that had a sob at the end of it. &#8220;He went in
somebody&#8217;s car and they were late coming. I&#8217;m
afraid he is going to miss his train and he has got
to get it or he will be in trouble! That is the last
train that connects with Wilmington.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s heart leaped to her opportunity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we try to catch him then,&#8221; proposed
Ruth gleefully. &#8220;My car can go pretty fast, and
if he has missed the train perhaps we can carry him
on to Wilmington. Would you like to try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, could we?&#8221; the voice throbbed with
eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up then. My car is all ready. I&#8217;ll be
down there in three minutes. We&#8217;ve no time to
waste. Put on something warm!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>She hung up the receiver without waiting for
further reply, and hurried softly out of the room
and down the back stairs.
</p>
<p>Thomas was well trained. The cars were always
in order. He was used to Ruth&#8217;s hurry calls, and
when she reached the garage she found the car
standing in the back street waiting for her. In a
moment more she was rushing on her way toward
the village without having aroused the suspicion of
the two men who so impatiently awaited her return.
Mrs. Cameron was ready, eager as a child, standing
on the sidewalk with a great blanket shawl over her
arm and looking up the street for her.
</p>
<p>It was not until they had swept through the
village, over the bridge, and were out on the broad
highway toward Chester that Ruth began to realize
what a wild goose chase she had undertaken. Just
where did she expect to find them, anyway? It was
now three minutes to five by the little clock in the
car and it was a full fifteen minutes&#8217; drive to
Chester. The plan had been to delay him on the
way to the train, and there had been mention of a
short cut. Could that be the rough stony road that
turned down sharply just beyond the stone quarry?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
It seemed hardly possible that anybody would attempt
to run a car over that road. Surely John
Cameron knew the roads about here well enough to
advise against it. Still, Ruth knew the locality like
a book and that was the only short cut thereabout.
If they had gone down there they might emerge at
the other end just in time to miss the train, and then
start on toward Wilmington. Or they might turn
back and take the longer way if they found the
short road utterly impassable. Which should she
take? Should she dare that rocky way? If only
there might be some tracks to guide her. But the
road was hard and dusty and told no tales of recent
travelers. They skimmed down the grade past the
stone quarry, and the short cut flashed into view,
rough and hilly, turning sharply away behind a
group of spruce trees. It was thick woods beyond.
If she went that way and got into any trouble with
her machine the chances were few that anyone would
some along to help. She had but a moment to decide,
and something told her that the long way was
the safe one and shorter in the end. She swept on,
her engine throbbing with that pleasant purr of expensive
well-groomed machinery, the car leaping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
forward as if it delighted in the high speed. The
little woman by her side sat breathless and eager,
with shining eyes, looking ahead for her boy.
</p>
<p>They passed car after car, and Ruth scanned the
occupants keenly. Some were filled with soldiers,
but John Cameron was not among them. She began
to be afraid that perhaps she ought after all to
have gone down that hilly way and made sure they
were not there. She was not quite sure where that
short road came out. If she knew she might run up
a little way from this further end.
</p>
<p>The two women sat almost silent, straining their
eyes ahead. They had said hardly a word since the
first greeting. Each seemed to understand the
thought of the other without words. For the
present they had but one common object, to find
John Cameron.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, as far ahead as they could see, a car
darted out of the wooded roadside, swung into their
road and plunged ahead at a tremendous rate. They
had a glimpse of khaki uniforms, but it was much
too far away to distinguish faces or forms. Nevertheless,
both women fastened their eyes upon it with
but one thought. Ruth put on more speed and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
forged ahead, thankful that she was not within city
lines yet, and that there was no one about to remind
her of the speed limit. Something told her
that the man she was seeking was in that car ahead.
</p>
<p>It was a thrilling race. Ruth said no word, but
she knew that her companion was aware that she
was chasing that car. Mrs. Cameron sat straight
and tense as if it had been a race of life and death, her
cheeks glowing and her eyes shining. Ruth was
grateful that she did not talk. Some women would
have talked incessantly.
</p>
<p>The other car did not go in to Chester proper at
all, but veered away into a branch road and Ruth
followed, leaping over the road as if it had been a
gray velvet ribbon. She did not seem to be gaining
on the car; but it was encouraging that they could
keep it still in sight. Then there came a sharp turn
of the road and it was gone. They were pulsing
along now at a tremendous rate. The girl had cast
caution to the winds. She was hearing the complacent
sneer of Harry Wainwright as he boasted
how they would get John Cameron into trouble, and
all the force of her strong young will was enlisted to
frustrate his plans.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>It was growing dusk, and lights leaped out on
the munition factories all about them. Along the
river other lights flashed and flickered in the white
mist that rose like a wreath. But Ruth saw nothing
of it all. She was straining her eyes for the
little black speck of a car which she had been following
and which now seemed to be swallowed up by
the evening. She had not relaxed her speed, and
the miles were whirling by, and she had a growing
consciousness that she might be passing the object
of her chase at any minute without knowing it.
Presently they came to a junction of three roads,
and she paused. On ahead the road was broad and
empty save for a car coming towards them. Off to
the right was a desolate way leading to a little cemetery.
Down to the left a smooth wooded road
wound into the darkness. There were sign boards
up. Ruth leaned out and flashed a pocket torch on
the board. &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>To Pine Tree Inn</span>, 7 Miles&#8221; it
read. Did she fancy it or was it really true that
she could hear the distant sound of a car among
the pines?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going down this way!&#8221; she said decidedly
to her companion, as if her action needed an explanation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
and she turned her car into the new road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s too late now,&#8221; said Mrs. Cameron
wistfully. &#8220;The train will be gone, of course, even
from Wilmington. And you ought to be going
home. I&#8217;m very wrong to have let you come so far;
and it&#8217;s getting dark. Your folks will be worrying
about you. That man will likely do his best to get
him to camp in time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ruth decidedly, &#8220;there&#8217;s no one at
home to worry just now, and I often go about alone
rather late. Besides, aren&#8217;t we having a good time?
We&#8217;re going a little further anyway before we
give up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She began to wonder in her heart if she ought
not to have told somebody else and taken Thomas
along to help. It was rather a questionable thing
for her to do, in the dusk of the evening&mdash;to women
all alone. But then, she had Mrs. Cameron along
and that made it perfectly respectable. But if she
failed now, what else could she do? Her blood
boiled hotly at the thought of letting Harry Wainwright
succeed in his miserable plot. Oh, for cousin
La Rue! He would have thought a way out of this.
If everything else failed she would tell the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
story to Captain La Rue and beg him to exonerate
John Cameron. But that, of course, she knew would
be hard to do, there was so much red tape in the
army, and there were so many unwritten laws that
could not be set aside just for private individuals.
Still, there must be a way if she had to go herself to
someone and tell what she had overheard. She set
her pretty lips firmly and rode on at a brisk pace
down the dark road, switching on her head lights
to seem the way here in the woods. And then suddenly,
just in time she jerked on the brake and
came to a jarring stop, for ahead of her a big car
was sprawled across the road, and there, rising hurriedly
from a kneeling posture before the engine,
in the full blaze of her headlights, blinking and
frowning with anxiety, stood John Cameron!

</div>

<p>The end of her chase came so unexpectedly that
her wits were completely scattered. Now that she
was face to face with the tall soldier she had nothing
to say for her presence there. What would he think
of her? How could she explain her coming? She
had undertaken the whole thing in such haste that
she had not planned ahead. Now she knew that
from the start she had understood that she must not
explain how she came to be possessed of any information
concerning him. She felt a kind of
responsible shame for her old playmate Harry
Wainright, and a certain loyalty toward her own
social set that prevented her from that, the only possible
explanation that could make her coming justifiable.
So, now in the brief interval before he had
recognized them she must stage the next act, and
she found herself unable to speak, her throat dry,
her lips for the instant paralyzed. It was the jubilant
little mother that stepped into the crisis and did
the most natural thing in the world:
</p>
<p>&#8220;John! Oh John! It&#8217;s really you! We&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
caught you!&#8221; she cried, and the troubled young
soldier peering into the dusk to discover if here was
a vehicle he might presume to commandeer to help
him out of his predicament lifted startled eyes to
the two faces in the car and strode forward, abandoning
with a clang the wrench with which he had
been working on the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; he said, a shade of deep anxiety in
his voice. &#8220;What is the matter? How came you
to be here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I came after you,&#8221; she said laughing
like a girl. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to see that you get to
camp in time. We&#8217;ve made pretty good time so
far. Jump in quick and we&#8217;ll tell you the rest on
the way. We mustn&#8217;t waste time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s startled gaze turned on Ruth now,
and a great wonder and delight sprang up in his
eyes. It was like the day when he went away on
the train, only more so, and it brought a rich flush
into Ruth&#8217;s cheeks. As she felt the hot waves she
was glad that she was sitting behind the light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You?&#8221; he breathed wonderingly.
&#8220;But this is too much! And after the way I
treated you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>His mother looked wonderingly from one to
the other:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in, John, quick. We mustn&#8217;t lose a
minute. Something might delay us later.&#8221; It was
plain she was deeply impressed with the necessity
for the soldier not to be found wanting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, please get in quickly, and let us start.
Then we can talk!&#8221; said Ruth, casting an anxious
glance toward the other car.
</p>
<p>His hand went out to the door to open it, the
wonder still shining in his face, when a low murmur
like a growl went up behind him.
</p>
<p>Ruth looked up, and there in the full glare of
the lights stood two burly civilians and a big soldier:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say!&#8221; drawled the soldier in no very
pleasant tone, &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to desert us that
way! Not after Pass came out of his way for us!
I didn&#8217;t think you had a yellow streak!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron paused and a troubled look came into
his face. He glanced at the empty back seat with
a repression of his disappointment in the necessity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another fellow here that has to get
back at the same time I do,&#8221; he said looking at
Ruth hesitatingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Ask him, of course.&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s voice
was hearty and put the whole car at his disposal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s room for you, too, Chalmers,&#8221; he said
with relief. &#8220;And Passmore will be glad to get rid
of us I suspect. He&#8217;ll be able to get home soon.
There isn&#8217;t much the matter with that engine. If
you do what I told you to that carburetor you&#8217;ll
find it will go all right. Come on, Chalmers. We
ought to hurry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks! I stick to my friends!&#8221; said the
soldier shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please!&#8221; said Cameron stepping on
the running board.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as <i>you</i> please!&#8221; said a gruff voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m
running this party and we all go together? See?&#8221;
A heavy hand came down upon Cameron&#8217;s shoulder
with a mighty grip.
</p>
<p>Cameron landed a smashing blow under the
man&#8217;s chin which sent him reeling and sprang inside
as Ruth threw in the clutch and sent her car leaping
forward. The two men in front were taken by surprise
and barely got out of the way in time, but
instantly recovered their senses and sprang after
the car, the one nearest her reaching for the wheel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Cameron, leaning forward, sent him rolling down
the gully, and Ruth turned the car sharply to avoid
the other car which was occupying as much of the
road as possible, and left the third man scrambling
to his knees behind her. It was taking a big chance
to dash past that car in the narrow space over rough
ground, but Ruth was not conscious of anything but
the necessity of getting away. In an instant they
were back in the road and flashing along through
the dark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, you better let me help you back here,&#8221;
said her son leaning forward and almost lifting his
mother into the back seat, then stepping over to
take her place beside Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better turn out your back lights!&#8221; he said in
a quiet, steady voice. &#8220;They might follow, you
know. They&#8217;re in an ugly mood. They&#8217;ve been
drinking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the car isn&#8217;t really out of commission?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seriously.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not on the right road, did you know?
This road goes to The Pine Tree Inn and
Singleton!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron gave a low exclamation:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;re headed for more liquor. I
thought something was up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a cross road back to the Pike?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. Probably. I know there is
about three miles farther on, almost to the Inn.
This is an awful mess to have got you into! I&#8217;d
rather have been in the guard house than have this
happen to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Ruth earnestly. &#8220;It&#8217;s an
adventure! I&#8217;m enjoying it. I&#8217;m not a doll to be
kept in cotton wool!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; said Cameron with deep
admiration in his tone. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t shown yourself
much of a doll to-night. Some doll, to run a
car the way you did in the face of all that. I&#8217;ll tell
you better what I think when we get out of this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming, I believe!&#8221; said Ruth glancing
back. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see a light? Look!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cameron was looking, too, through the
little back window. Now she spoke quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to get out and slip up in
the woods till they have gone by?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother!&#8221; said Cameron quickly, &#8220;just
you sit quiet where you are and trust us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Something awful might happen, John!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother! Don&#8217;t you worry!&#8221; he said in
his gentle, manly tone. Then to Ruth: &#8220;There&#8217;s a
big barn ahead there on your left. Keep your eye
out for a road around behind it. If we could disappear
it&#8217;s too dark for them to know where we
are. Would you care to turn out all the lights and
let me run the car? I don&#8217;t want to boast but there
isn&#8217;t much of anything I can&#8217;t do with a car when
I have to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instantly Ruth switched out every light and
with a relieved &#8220;Please!&#8221; gave up the wheel to
him. They made the change swiftly and silently,
and Ruth took the post of lookout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can see two lights. It might be someone
else, mightn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not likely, on this road. But we&#8217;re not taking
any chances,&#8221; and with that the car bumped
down across a gully and lurched up to a grassy approach
to a big stone barn that loomed above them,
then slid down another bank and passed close to a
great haystack, whose clutching straw fingers
reached out to brush their faces, and so swept
softly around to the rear of the barn and stopped.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Cameron shut off the engine instantly and they sat
in utter silence listening to the oncoming car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s they, all right!&#8221; whispered Cameron
softly. &#8220;That&#8217;s Passmore&#8217;s voice. He converses
almost wholly in choice profanity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother&#8217;s hand stole out to touch his shoulder
and he reached around and held it close.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tremble, mother, we&#8217;re all safe!&#8221; he
whispered in a tone so tender that Ruth felt a shiver
of pleasure pass over her for the mother who had
such a son. Also there was the instant thought
that a man could not be wholly &#8220;rotten&#8221; when he
could speak to his mother in that tone.
</p>
<p>There was a breathless space when the car
paused on the road not far away and their pursuers
stood up and looked around, shouting to one another.
There was no mistaking their identity now.
Ruth shivered visibly. One of them got out of the
car and came toward the barn. They could hear
him stepping over the stony roadside. Cameron
laid a quiet hand of reassuring protection on her
arm that steadied her and made her feel wonderfully
safe once more, and strange to say she found
herself lifting up another queer little kind of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
prayer. It had never been her habit to pray much
except in form. Her heart had seldom needed anything
that money could not supply.
</p>
<p>The man had stumbled across the gully and up
toward the barn. They could hear him swearing
at the unevenness of the ground, and Ruth held her
breath and prayed again. A moment more and he
was fumbling about for the barn door and calling
for a flash light. Then, like the distant sound of a
mighty angel of deliverance came the rumble of a
car in the distance. The men heard it and took it
for their quarry on ahead. They climbed into their
car again and were gone like a flash.
</p>
<p>John Cameron did not wait for them to get far
away. He set the car in motion as soon as they
were out of sight, and its expensive mechanism
obeyed his direction almost silently as he guided it
around the barn, behind the haystack and back
again into the road over which they had just come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; he said as he put the car to its best
speed and switched on its headlights again. &#8220;Now
we can beat them to it, I guess, if they come back
this way, which I don&#8217;t think they will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The car dashed over the ground and the three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
sat silent while they passed into the woods and over
the place where they had first met Cameron. Ruth
felt herself trembling again, and her teeth beginning
to chatter from the strain. Cameron seemed
to realize her feeling and turned toward her:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been wonderful!&#8221; he said flashing a
warm look at her, &#8220;and you, too, mother!&#8221; lifting
his voice a little and turning his head toward the
back seat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any other two women in
Bryne Haven could have gone through a scene like
that and kept absolutely still. You were great!&#8221;
There was that in his voice that lifted Ruth&#8217;s heart
more than any praise she had ever received for anything.
She wanted to make some acknowledgment,
but she found to her surprise that tears were
choking her throat so that she could not speak. It
was the excitement, of course, she told herself, and
struggled to get control of her emotion.
</p>
<p>They emerged from the woods and in sight
of the Pike at last, and Cameron drew a long
breath of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, I guess we can hold our own with anyone,
now,&#8221; he said settling back in his seat, but relaxing
none of his vigilance toward the car which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
sped along the highway like a winged thing. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s time I heard how you came to be here. I haven&#8217;t
been able to explain it, during the intervals when
I&#8217;ve had any chance at all to think about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I just called up your mother to know if it
would help you any to be taken to your train,&#8221; said
Ruth quickly, &#8220;and she mentioned that she was
worried lest you would miss it; so I suggested that
we try to catch you and take you on to Wilmington
or Baltimore or wherever you have to go. I do hope
this delay hasn&#8217;t spoiled it all. How long does it
take to go from Baltimore to camp. I&#8217;ve taken the
Baltimore trip myself in five hours. It&#8217;s only
quarter past six yet, do you think we can make it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t go all the way to Baltimore!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;What would you and mother do at
that time of night alone after I go to camp? You see,
it isn&#8217;t as if I could stay and come back with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll just go to a hotel in Baltimore, won&#8217;t
we, Mrs. Cameron? We&#8217;ll be all right if we only
get you safe to camp. Do you think we can do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we can do it all right with this car.
But I&#8217;m quite sure I ought not to let you do it just
for me. What will your people think?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left word that I&#8217;ve gone to a friend in
trouble,&#8221; twinkled Ruth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call them up when
I get to Baltimore, and make it all right with
Auntie. She will trust me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron turned and looked at her wonderingly,
reverently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful that you should do this for me,&#8221;
he said in a low tone, quite low, so that the watching
wistful mother could not even guess what he
was saying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not in the least wonderful,&#8221; said Ruth
brightly. &#8220;Remember the hedge and Chuck Woodcock!&#8221;
She was beginning to get her self possession
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are paying that old score back in compound
interest,&#8221; said Cameron.
</p>
<p>That was a wonderful ride rushing along beneath
the stars, going back to childhood&#8217;s days and
getting acquainted again where they left off. Ruth
forgot all about the cause of her wild chase, and the
two young men she had left disconsolate in her
library at home; forgot her own world in this new
beautiful one, wherein her spirit really communed
with another spirit; forgot utterly what Wainwright
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
had said about Cameron as more and more
through their talk she came to see the fineness of
his character.
</p>
<p>They flashed on from one little village to another,
leaving one clustering glimmer of lights in
the distance only to pass to other clustering groups.
It was in their favor that there were not many other
travellers to dispute their way, and they were hindered
very little. Cameron had made the trip many
times and knew the roads well. They did not have
to hesitate and enquire the way. They made good
time. The clocks were striking ten when they
reached the outskirts of Baltimore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Ruth in a sweetly imperious tone,
consulting her timepiece to be sure she had counted
the clock strokes correctly, &#8220;do you know what you
are going to do, Mr. Corporal? You are going to
land your mother and me at the nearest hotel, and
take the car with you back to camp. You said one
of the fellows had his car down there, so I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;ll be able to find a place to put it over night. If
you find a way to send the car back to us in the
morning, well and good. If not your mother and I
will go home by train and the chauffeur can come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
down to-morrow and bring back the car; or, better
still, you can drive yourself up the next time you
get leave off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was much argument about the matter
within a brief space of time, but in the end (which
came in five minutes) Ruth had her way, and the
young soldier departed for his camp in the gray car
with ample time to make the short trip, leaving his
mother and Ruth at a Baltimore hotel; after having
promised to call up in the morning and let them
know what he could do about the car.
</p>
<p>Ruth selected a large double room and went at
once to the telephone to call up her aunt. She
found to her relief that that good lady had not yet
returned from her day with a friend in the city, so
that no explanations would be necessary that night.
She left word with the servant that she was in Baltimore
with a friend and would probably be at home
the next day sometime. Then she turned to find
to her dismay that her companion was sitting in a
low-armed chair with tears running down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; she exclaimed rushing over to
her, &#8220;you are all worn out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; sobbed the mother with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
smile like sunshine through her tears. &#8220;I was so
happy I couldn&#8217;t keep from crying. Don&#8217;t you
ever get that way? I&#8217;ve just been watching you and
thinking what a dear beautiful child you are and
how wonderful God has been to send you to help
my boy. Oh, it was so dreadful to me to think of
him going down to camp with those men! My dear,
I smelt liquor on their breath when they came for
him, and I was just crying and praying about it
when you called me up. Of course, I knew my boy
wouldn&#8217;t drink, but so many accidents can happen
with automobiles when the driver is drunk! My
dear, I never can thank you enough!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were both too excited to sleep soon, but
long after the mother was asleep Ruth lay awake
going over the whole day and wondering. There
were so many things about the incident of the afternoon
and evening, now that they were over, that
were utterly out of accord with her whole life heretofore.
She felt intuitively that her aunt would
never understand if she were to explain the whole
proceeding. There were so many laws of her little
world of conventionalities that she had transgressed,
and so many qualms of a belated conscience about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
whether she ought to have done it at all. What
would Cameron think of her, anyway? Her cheeks
burned hot in the dark over that question. Strange
she had not thought of it at all either beforehand or
while she sat beside him during that wonderful ride!
And now the thing that Wainwright had said
shouted itself out to her ears: &#8220;Rotten! Rotten!
Rotten!&#8221; like a dirge. Suppose he were? It
<i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be true. It <i>just couldn&#8217;t</i>, but suppose he
were? Well, suppose he were! How was she hurt
by doing a kind act? Having taken that stand
against all her former ideas Ruth had instant
peace and drifted into dreams of what she had been
enjoying, the way suddenly lit by a sleepy remembrance
of Wetherill&#8217;s declaration: &#8220;He won&#8217;t
drink! You can&#8217;t make him! It&#8217;s been tried again
and again!&#8221; There was evidence in his favor. Why
hadn&#8217;t she remembered that before? And his
mother! She had been so sure of him!
</p>
<p>The telephone bell wakened her with a message
from camp. His voice greeted her pleasantly with
the word that it was all right, he had reached
camp in plenty of time, found a good place for the
car, and it would be at the hotel at nine o&#8217;clock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Ruth turned from the phone with a vague disappointment.
He had not said a word of thanks or
good-bye or anything, only that he must hurry. Not
even a word to his mother. But then, of course,
men did not think of those little things, perhaps, as
women did, and maybe it was just as well for him
to take it all as a matter of course. It made it less
embarrassing for her.
</p>
<p>But when they went down to the car, behold he
was in it!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got leave off for the morning,&#8221; he explained
smiling. &#8220;I told my captain all about how you got
me back in time when I&#8217;d missed the train and he
told me to see you as far as Wilmington and catch
the noon train back from there. He&#8217;s a peach of a
captain. If my lieutenant had been there I wouldn&#8217;t
have got a chance to ask him. I was afraid of that
last night. But for good luck the lieutenant has a
two days&#8217; leave this time. He&#8217;s a mess!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth looked at him musingly. Was Harry
Wainwright the lieutenant?
</p>
<p>They had a golden morning together, and talked
of many things that welded a friendship already
well begun.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you at all frightened last night?&#8221;
asked Cameron once, looking at the delicate beauty
of the face beside him and noting the strength and
sweetness of it.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cameron was dozing in the back seat and
they felt quite alone and free. Ruth looked up at
him frankly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I think I was for a minute or two
while we were behind that barn, but&mdash;&mdash;Did you
ever pray when you were in a trying situation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked down earnestly into her face, half
startled at her words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know that I ever did. I&#8217;m not
quite sure if it was praying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that I ever did before,&#8221;
she went on thoughtfully, &#8220;but last night when
those men got out of their car in front of the barn
so near us again, I found myself praying.&#8221; She
dropped her eyes half embarrassed: &#8220;Just as if I
were a frightened little child I found myself saying:
&#8216;God help us! God help us!&#8217; And right away we
heard that other car coming and the men went away.
It somehow seemed&mdash;well, strange! I wondered
if anybody else ever had an experience like that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them,&#8221; said Cameron gravely.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve wondered sometimes myself. Do you believe
in God?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Ruth quite firmly. &#8220;Of course.
What use would there be in anything if there wasn&#8217;t
a God?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you believe we humans can ever really&mdash;well,
<i>find</i> Him? On this earth, I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know that I ever thought about
it,&#8221; she answered bewildered. &#8220;Find Him? In
what way do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, get in touch with Him? Get to know
Him, perhaps. Be on such terms with Him that
one could call out in a time like last night, you
know; or&mdash;well, say in a battle! I&#8217;ve been thinking
a lot about that lately&mdash;naturally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Ruth softly, &#8220;of course. I
hadn&#8217;t thought about that much, either. We&#8217;ve
been so thoughtless&mdash;and&mdash;and sort of happy you
know, just like butterflies, we girls! I haven&#8217;t realized
that men were going out to face <i>Death</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that I&#8217;m afraid to die,&#8221; said Cameron
proudly lifting his chin as if dying were a small
matter, &#8220;not just the dying part. I reckon I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
been through worse than that a dozen times. That
wouldn&#8217;t last long. It&#8217;s&mdash;the other part. I have a
feeling there&#8217;ll be a little something more expected
of me than just to have tried to get the most fun out
of life. I&#8217;ve been thinking if there is a God He&#8217;d
expect us to find it out and make things straight
between us somehow. I suppose I don&#8217;t make myself
very plain. I don&#8217;t believe I know myself just
what I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand just a little,&#8221; said Ruth,
&#8220;I have never thought about it before, but I&#8217;m
going to now. It&#8217;s something we ought to think
about, I guess. In a sense it&#8217;s something that each
one of us has to think, whether we are going into
battle or not, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is, only we never realize it when
things are going along all right,&#8221; said Cameron.
&#8220;It seems queer that everybody that&#8217;s ever lived
on this earth has had this question to face sooner or
later and most of them haven&#8217;t done much about it.
The few people who profess to have found a way to
meet it we call cranks, or else pick flaws in the way
they live; although it does seem to me that if I
really found God so I was sure He was there and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
cared about me, I&#8217;d manage to live a little decenter
life than some do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drifted into other topics and all too soon
they reached Wilmington and had to say good-bye.
But the thought stayed with Ruth more or less during
the days that followed, and crept into her letters
when she wrote to Corporal Cameron, as she did
quite often in these days; and still no solution had
come to the great question which was so like the one
of old, &#8220;What shall I do to be saved?&#8221; It came
and went during the days that followed, and now
and again the fact that it had originated in a talk
with Cameron clashed badly in her mind with that
word &#8220;Rotten&#8221; that Wainwright had used about
him. So that at last she resolved to talk to her
cousin, Captain La Rue, the next time he came up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Captain,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do you know a
boy at your camp from Bryne Haven named John
Cameron?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do!&#8221; said the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a man is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The best young man I know in every way,&#8221;
answered the captain promptly. &#8220;If the world
were made up of men like him it would be a pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
good place in which to live. Do you know him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; said Ruth evasively, with a satisfied
smile on her lips. &#8220;His mother is in our Red Cross
now. She thinks he&#8217;s about right, of course, but
mothers usually do, I guess. I&#8217;ll have to tell her
what you said. It will please her. He used to be in
school with me years ago. I haven&#8217;t seen much of
him since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, all I have to say is, improve your
acquaintance if you get the chance. He&#8217;s worth ten
to one of your society youths that loll around here
almost every time I come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Cousin Captain!&#8221; chided Ruth. But
she went off smiling and she kept all his words in
her heart.

<h2>XII</h2>
</div>

<p>Corporal Cameron did not soon return to his
native town. An epidemic of measles broke out in
camp just before Thanksgiving and pursued its
tantalizing course through his special barracks with
strenuous vigor. Quarantine was put on for three
weeks, and was but lifted for a few hours when a
new batch of cases came down. Seven weeks more
of isolation followed, when the men were not allowed
away from the barracks except for long lonely
walks, or gallops across camp. Even the mild excitements
of the Y.M.C.A. huts were not for them
in these days. They were much shut up to themselves,
and latent tendencies broke loose and ran
riot. Shooting crap became a passion. They
gambled as long as they had a dollar left or could
get credit on the next month&#8217;s pay day. Then they
gambled for their shirts and their bayonets. All
day long whenever they were in the barracks, you
could hear the rattle of the dice, and the familiar
call of &#8220;Phoebe,&#8221; &#8220;Big Dick,&#8221; &#8220;Big Nick,&#8221; and
&#8220;Little Joe.&#8221; When they were not on drill the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
men would infest the barracks for hours at a time,
gathered in crouching groups about the dice, the air
thick and blue with cigarette smoke; while others
had nothing better to do than to sprawl on their
cots and talk; and from their talk Cameron often
turned away nauseated. The low ideals, the open
boasting of shame, the matter-of-course conviction
that all men and most women were as bad as themselves,
filled him with a deep boiling rage, and he
would close his book or throw down the paper with
which he was trying to while the hour, and fling
forth into the cold air for a solitary ride or walk.
</p>
<p>He was sitting thus a cold cheerless December
day with a French book he had recently sent for,
trying to study a little and prepare himself for the
new country to which he was soon going.
</p>
<p>The door of the barracks opened letting in a
rush of cold air, and closed again quickly. A tall
man in uniform with the red triangle on his arm
stood pulling off his woolen gloves and looking
about him. Nobody paid any attention to him.
Cameron was deep in his book and did not even
notice him. Off at his left a new crap game was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
just starting. The phraseology beat upon his accustomed
ears like the buzz of bees or mosquitos.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot a buck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re faded!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now there, dice! Remember the
baby&#8217;s shoes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron had ceased to hear the voices. He was
struggling with a difficult French idiom.
</p>
<p>The stranger took his bearings deliberately and
walked over to Cameron, sitting down with a
friendly air on the nearest cot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be interested in having one of my
little books?&#8221; he asked, and his voice had a clear
ring that brought Cameron&#8217;s thoughts back to the
barracks again. He looked up for a curt refusal.
He did not wish to be bothered now, but something
in the young man&#8217;s earnest face held him. Y.M.C.A.
men in general were well enough, but Cameron
wasn&#8217;t crazy about them, especially when they
were young. But this one had a look about him
that proclaimed him neither a slacker nor a sissy.
Cameron hesitated:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a book?&#8221; he asked in a somewhat
curt manner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>The boy, for he was only a boy though he was
tall as a man, did not hedge but went straight to the
point, looking eagerly at the soldier:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pocket Testament,&#8221; he said earnestly, and
laid in Cameron&#8217;s hand a little book with limp
leather covers. Cameron took it up half curiously,
and then looked into the other&#8217;s face almost coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You selling them?&#8221; There was a covert sneer
in his tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; said the other quickly, &#8220;I&#8217;m giving
them away for a promise. You see, I had an accident
and one of my eyes was put out a while ago.
Of course, they wouldn&#8217;t take me for a soldier, and
the next best thing was to be all the help I could to
the fellows that are going to fight. I figure that
book is the best thing I can bring you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The manly simplicity of the boy held Cameron&#8217;s
gaze firmly fixed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! In what way?&#8221; Cameron was turning
the leaves curiously, enjoying the silky fineness and
the clear-cut print and soft leather binding. Life
in the barracks was so much in the rough that any
bit of refinement was doubly appreciated. He liked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
the feel of the little book and had a curious longing
to be its possessor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it gives you a pretty straight line on
where we&#8217;re all going, what is expected of us, and
how we&#8217;re to be looked out for. It shows one how to
know God and be ready to meet death if we have to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think anyone can know God
on this earth?&#8221; asked Cameron sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because <i>I</i> have,&#8221; said the astonishing young
man quite as if he were saying he were related to the
President or something like that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have! How did you get to know Him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Through that little book and by following its
teachings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron turned over the pages again, catching
familiar phrases here and there as he had heard
them sometimes in Sunday school years ago.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said something about a promise. What
was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;ll carry the book with you always,
and read at least a verse in it every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t sound hard,&#8221; mused Cameron.
&#8220;I guess I could stand for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The book is yours, then. Would you like to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
put your name to that acceptance card in the front
of the book?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Cameron sharply as if
he had discovered the fly in the ointment for which
he had all along been suspicious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call it the first step in knowing God.
It&#8217;s your act of acceptance of the way God has
planned for you to be forgiven and saved from sin.
If you sign that you say you will accept Christ as
your Saviour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose you don&#8217;t believe in Christ? I
can&#8217;t commit myself to anything like that till I
know about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, that&#8217;s the first move in getting
to know God,&#8221; said the stranger with a smile.
&#8220;God says he wants you to believe in his Son.
He asks that much of you if you want to get to
know Him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron looked at him with bewildered interest.
Was here a possible answer to the questions of his
heart. Why did this curious boy have a light in his
face that never came from earth or air? What
was there about his simple earnestness that was
so convincing?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Another crap game had started up on the other
side of them. A musically inclined private was
playing ragtime on the piano, and another was
trying to accompany him on the banjo. The air
was hazier than ever. It seemed strange to be talking
of such things in these surroundings:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of here and walk!&#8221; said Cameron,
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to understand what you mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For two hours they tramped across the frozen
ground and talked, arguing this way and that, much
drawn toward one another. At last in the solemn
background of a wall of whispering pines that shut
them away from the stark gray rows of barracks,
Cameron took out his fountain pen and with his foot
on a prone log, opened the little book on his knee
and wrote his name and the date. Then he put it in
his breast pocket with the solemn feeling that he
had taken some kind of a great step toward what his
soul had been longing to find. They knelt on the
frozen ground beside that log and the stranger
prayed simply as if he were talking to a friend.
Thereafter that spot was hallowed ground to Cameron,
to which he came often to think and to read
his little book.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>That night he wrote to Ruth, telling in a shy
way of his meeting with the Testament man and
about the little book. After he had mailed the letter
he walked back again to the spot among the pines
and standing there looked up to the stars and somehow
committed himself again to the covenant he had
signed in the little book. It was then that he decided
that if he got home again after quarantine
before he went over, he would unite with the church.
Somehow the stranger&#8217;s talk that afternoon had
cleared away his objections. On his way back to
the barracks across the open field, up through the
woods and over the crest of the hill toward the road
as he walked thinking deeply, suddenly from down
below on the road a familiar voice floated up to him.
He parted the branches of oak underbrush that
made a screen between him and the road and
glanced down to get his bearings the better to avoid
an unwelcome meeting. It was inevitable when one
came near Lieutenant Wainwright that he would
overhear some part of a conversation for he had a
carrying voice which he never sought to restrain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s a girl with pep, are you? I
don&#8217;t want to bother with any other kind. All right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Tell her to wait for me in the Washington station
to-morrow evening at eight. I&#8217;ll look for her at the
right of the information booth. Tell her to wear a
red carnation so I&#8217;ll know her. I&#8217;ll show her a good
time, all right, if she&#8217;s the right sort. I&#8217;ll trust you
that she&#8217;s a good looker!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron could not hear the response, but the
two were standing silhouetted against a distant
light, and something in the attitude of the other
man held his attention. For a moment he could not
place him, then it flashed across his mind that this
was the soldier Chambers, who had been the means
of his missing the train at Chester on the memorable
occasion when Ruth Macdonald had saved the day.
It struck him as a strange thing that these two
enemies of his whom he would have supposed to be
strangers to one another should be talking thus intimately.
To make sure of the man&#8217;s identity he
waited until the two parted and Wainwright went
his way, and then at a distance followed the other
one until he was quite certain. He walked back
thoughtfully trying to make it out. Had Wainwright
then been at the bottom of his trouble that
day? It began to seem quite possible. And how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
had Ruth Macdonald happened to be so opportunely
present at the right moment? How had she
happened to turn down that road, a road that was
seldom used by people going to Baltimore? It was
all very strange and had never been satisfactorily
explained. Ruth had evaded the question most
plausibly every time he had brought it up. Could
it be that Wainwright had told her of a plot against
him and she had reached out to help him? His heart
leaped at the thought. Then at once he was sure
that Wainwright had never told her, unless perhaps
he had told some tale against him, and made
him the butt of a great joke. Well, if he had she
had cared enough to defend him and help him out
without ever giving away the fact that she knew.
But here, too, lay a thorn to disturb him. Why
had Ruth Macdonald not told him the plain truth
if she knew? Was she trying to shield Harry
Wainwright? Could she really care for that
contemptible scoundrel?
</p>
<p>The thought in all its phases tore his mind and
kept him awake for hours, for the crux of the whole
matter was that he was afraid that Ruth Macdonald
was going to marry Lieutenant Wainwright, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
he knew that it was not only for her sake, but for
his also that he did not want this&mdash;that it was agony
even to contemplate.
</p>
<p>He told himself, of course, that his interest was
utterly unselfish. That she was nothing to him but
a friend and never would be, and that while it might
be hard to see her belong to some fine man and know
he never might be more than a passing friend, still it
would not be like seeing her tied to a rotten unprincipled
fellow like Wainwright. The queer part of
it was that the word &#8220;rotten&#8221; in connection with his
enemy played a great part in his thoughts that night.
</p>
<p>Somewhere in the watches of the night a memory
came to him of the covenant he had made that day
and a vague wistful reaching of his heart after the
Christ to whom he was supposed to have surrendered
his life. He wondered if a Christ such as the
stranger had claimed He had, would take an interest
in the affairs of Ruth Macdonald. Surely, such
a flower of a girl would be protected if there was
protection for anyone! And somehow he managed
a queer little prayer for her, the first he had tried to
put up. It helped him a little, and toward morning
he fell asleep.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>A few days later in glancing through his newly
acquired Testament he came upon a verse which
greatly troubled him for a time. His eye had
caught it at random and somehow it lodged in
his mind:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
another, if any man have a quarrel against any:
even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somehow the principle of that verse did not fit
with his proud spirit. He thought instantly of
Wainwright&#8217;s distasteful face and form. It seemed
to loom before him with a smug triumphal sneer.
His enmity toward the fellow had been of years
standing, and had been deepened many times by
unforgetable acts. There was nothing about Wainwright
to make one forgive him. There was
everything about him to make one want to punish
him. When the verse first confronted Cameron he
felt a rising indignation that there had been so much
as a connection in his thoughts with his quarrel with
Wainwright. Why, anybody that knew him knew
Wainwright was wrong. God must think so, too.
That verse might apply to little quarrels but not to
his feeling about the way Wainwright had treated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
him ever since they were children. That was not to
be borne, of course. Those words he had called
Cameron&#8217;s father! How they made his blood boil
even now! No, he would not forbear nor forgive
Wainwright. God would not want him to do so.
It was right he should be against him forever!
Thus he dismissed the suggestion and turned to the
beginning of his testament, having determined to
find the Christ of whom the stranger had set him
in search.
</p>
<p>On the flyleaf of the little book the stranger
had written a few words:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;And ye shall find me, when ye shall search for me with
all your heart.&#8221;&mdash;Jeremiah xxix: 13.
</p>
</div>
<p>That meant no half-way business. He could
understand that. Well, he was willing to put himself
into the search fully. He understood that it
was worth a whole-hearted search if one were really
to find a God as a reward.
</p>
<p>That night he wrote a letter to the minister in
Bryne Haven asking for an interview when next
he was able to get leave from camp. In the meantime
he kept out of the way of Wainwright most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
adroitly, and found many ways to avoid a meeting.
</p>
<p>There had been three awful days when his
&#8220;peach of a captain&#8221; about whom he had spoken
to Ruth, had been called away on some military
errand and Wainwright had been the commanding
officer. They had been days of gall and wormwood
to Cameron, for his proud spirit could not bend to
salute the man whom he considered a scoundrel,
and Wainwright took a fine delight in using his
power over his enemy to the limit. If it had not
been for the unexpected return of the captain a day
earlier than planned, Cameron might have had to
suffer humiliations far greater than he did.
</p>
<p>The bitterness between the two grew stronger,
and Cameron went about with his soul boiling with
rage and rebellion. It was only when Ruth&#8217;s letters
came that he forgot it all for a few minutes and
lifted his thoughts to higher things.

<h2>XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>It was a clear, crisp day in March with just a
smell of Spring in the air, when Cameron finally
united with the church.
</p>
<p>He had taken a long time to think about it.
Quarantine had extended itself away into February,
and while his company had had its regular
drill and hard work, there had been no leave from
camp, no going to Y.M.C.A. huts, and no visiting
canteens. They had been shut up to the company
of the members of their own barracks, and there
were times when that palled upon Cameron to a
distressing degree. Once when it had snowed for
three days, and rained on the top of it, and a chill
wind had swept into the cracks and crannies of the
barracks, and poured down from the ventilators in
the roofs. The old stoves were roaring their best to
keep up good cheer, and the men lay on their cots
in rows talking; telling their vile stories, one after
another, each to sound bigger than the last, some
mere lads boasting of wild orgies, and all finally
drifting into a chat on a sort of philosophy of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
lowest ideals. Cameron lay on his cot trying to
sleep, for he had been on guard all night, and a
letter from Ruth was in his inside pocket with a
comfortable crackle, but the talk that drifted about
him penetrated even his army blankets when he
drew them up over his ears.
</p>
<p>The fellows had arrived at a point where a
young lad from Texas had stated with a drawl that
all girls were more or less bad; that this talk of the
high standards of womanhood was all bosh; that
there was one standard for men and women, yes,
but it was man&#8217;s standard, not woman&#8217;s, as was
written sometimes. White womanhood! Bah!
There was no such thing!
</p>
<p>In vain Cameron stuffed the blanket about his
ears, resolutely shut his eyes and tried to sleep. His
very blood boiled in his veins. The letter in his
pocket cried out to be exonerated from this wholesale
blackening. Suddenly Cameron flung the
blanket from him and sprang to his feet with a
single motion, a tall soldier with a white flame of
wrath in his face, his eyes flashing with fire. They
called him in friendly derision the &#8220;Silent Corporal&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
because he kept so much to himself, but now
he blazed forth at them:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie, Kelly! You know you do! The
whole lot of you are liars! You know that rot
you&#8217;ve been talking isn&#8217;t true. You know that it&#8217;s
to cover up your own vile deeds and to excuse your
own lustful passions that you talk this way and try
to persuade your hearts and consciences that you
are no worse than the girls you have dishonored!
But it isn&#8217;t so and you know it! There <i>are</i> good
women! There always have been and there always
will be! You, every one of you, know at least one.
You are dishonoring your mothers and your sisters
when you talk that way. You are worse than the
beasts you are going out to fight. That&#8217;s the rotten
stuff they are teaching. They call it Kultur!
You&#8217;ll never win out against them if you go in that
spirit, for it&#8217;s their spirit and nothing more. You&#8217;ve
got to go clean! If there&#8217;s a God in heaven He&#8217;s in
this war, and it&#8217;s got to be a clean war! And you&#8217;ve
got to begin by thinking differently of women or
you&#8217;re just as bad as the Huns!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With that he seized his poncho, stamped out into
the storm, and tramped for two hours with a driving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
sleet in his face, his thoughts a fury of holy
anger against unholy things, and back of it all the
feeling that he was the knight of true womanhood.
She had sent him forth and no man in his presence
should defile the thought of her. It was during
that tramp that he had made up his mind to ally
himself with God&#8217;s people. Whether it would do
any good in the long run in his search for God or
not, whether he even was sure he believed in God or
not, he would do that much if he were permitted.
</p>
<p>His interview with the minister had not made
things much plainer. He had been told that he
would grow into things. That the church was the
shepherd-fold of the soul, that he would be nurtured
and taught, that by and by these doubts and fears
would not trouble him. He did not quite see it,
how he was to be nurtured on the distant battlefield
of France, but it was a mystical thing, anyway,
and he accepted the statement and let it go at
that. One thing that stuck in his heart and troubled
him deeply was the way the minister talked to him
about love and fellowship with his fellow men. As
a general thing, Cameron had no trouble with his
companions in life, but there were one or two, notably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Wainwright and a young captain friend of
his at camp, named Wurtz, toward whom his enmity
almost amounted to hatred.
</p>
<p>He was not altogether sure that the ministers
suggestion that he might love the sinner and hate
the sin would hold good with regard to Wainwright;
but there had been only a brief time before the communion
service and he had had to let the matter go.
His soul was filled with a holy uplifting as he
stepped out from the pastor&#8217;s study and followed
into the great church.
</p>
<p>It had startled him just a little to find so many
people there. In contemplating this act of allying
himself with God he had always thought of it as
being between himself and God, with perhaps the
minister and an elder or two. He sat down in the
place indicated for him much disturbed in spirit.
It had always been an annoyance to him to be
brought to the notice of his fellow townsmen, and
a man in uniform in these days was more than ever
an object of interest. His troubled gaze was downward
during the opening hymns and prayers. But
when he came to stand and take his vows he lifted
his eyes, and there, off at one side where the seats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
grouped in a sort of transept, he caught a glimpse
of Ruth Macdonald standing beside her tall Captain-cousin
who was home for the day, and there
was a light in her eyes that steadied him and
brought back the solemnity of the moment once
more. It thrilled him to think she was there. He
had not realized before that this must be her church.
In fact, he had not thought of it as being any
church in particular, but as being a part of the great
church invisible to which all God&#8217;s children belonged.
It had not occurred to him until that morning,
either, that his mother might be hurt that he
had not chosen her church. But when he spoke to
her about it she shook her head and smiled. She
was only glad of what he was doing. There were
no regrets. She was too broad minded to stop about
creeds. She was sitting there meekly over by the
wall now, her hands folded quietly in her lap, tears
of joy in her eyes. She, too, had seen Ruth Macdonald
and was glad, but she wondered who the tall
captain by her side might be.
</p>
<p>It happened that Cameron was the only person
uniting by confession at that time, for the quarantine
had held him beyond the time the pastor had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
spoken of when so many were joining, and he stood
alone, tall and handsome in his uniform, and
answered in a clear, deep voice: &#8220;I do,&#8221; &#8220;I will!&#8221;
as the vows were put upon him one by one. Every
word he meant from his heart, a longing for the
God who alone could satisfy the longings of his soul.
</p>
<p>He thrilled with strange new enthusiasm as the
congregation of church members were finally called
upon to rise and receive him into their fellowship,
and looking across he saw Ruth Macdonald again
and his beloved Captain La Rue standing together
while everybody sang:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Blest be the tie that binds</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Our hearts in Christian love;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The fellowship of kindred minds</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Is like to that above.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But when the bread and the wine had been partaken
of, the solemn prayer of dedication spoken,
the beautiful service was over, and the rich tones of
the organ were swelling forth, he suddenly felt
strange and shy among all that crowd of people
whom he knew by sight only. The elders and some
of the other men and women shook hands with him,
and he was trying to slip away and find his mother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
when a kindly hand was laid upon his shoulder and
there stood the captain with Ruth beside him, and
a warm hand shake of welcome into the church.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you have taken
this step. You will never regret it, Cameron. It is
good that we can be of the same company here if we
have failed in other ways.&#8221; Then turning to Ruth
he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you, did I, Ruth, that I&#8217;ve failed
in trying to get Cameron transferred to my division?
I did everything I could, but they&#8217;ve turned
down my application flatly. It seems like stupidity
to me, for it was just the place for which he was
most fitted, but I guess it&#8217;s because he was too much
of a man to stay in a quiet sector and do such work.
If he had been maimed or half blinded they might
have considered him. They need him in his present
place, and I am the poorer for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a glow in Ruth&#8217;s eyes as she put her
hand in Cameron&#8217;s and said simply: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
you&#8217;re one of us now,&#8221; that warmed his heart with a
great gladness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were a member,&#8221; he said
wonderingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I&#8217;ve been a member since I was
fourteen,&#8221; she said, and suddenly he felt that he had
indeed come into a holy and blessed communion.
If he had not yet found God, at least he was standing
on the same ground with one of his holy
children.
</p>
<p>That was the last time he got home before he
sailed. Shipping quarantine was put on his company
the very next week, the camp was closed to
visitors, and all passes annulled. The word came
that they would be going over in a few days, but
still they lingered, till the days grew into three
weeks, and the Spring was fully upon them in all its
beauty, touching even the bare camp with a fringe
of greenness and a sprinkle of wild bloom in the
corners where the clearing had not been complete.
</p>
<p>Added to his other disappointments, a direful
change had taken place at camp. The &#8220;peach of a
captain&#8221; had been raised to the rank of major and
Captain Wurtz had been put in his place. It seemed
as if nothing worse could be.
</p>
<p>The letters had been going back and forth rather
often of late, and Cameron had walked to the loneliest
spot in the camp in the starlight and had it out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
with himself. He knew now that Ruth Macdonald
was the only girl in all the world to him. He also
knew that there was not a chance in a thousand that
he could ever be more to her than he now was. He
knew that the coming months held pain for him,
and yet, he would not go back and undo this beautiful
friendship, no, not for all the pain that might
come. It was worth it, every bit.
</p>
<p>He had hoped to get one more trip home, and
she had wanted to see the camp, had said that perhaps
when the weather got warmer she might run
down some day with his mother, but now the quarantine
was on and that was out of the question.
He walked alone to the places he would have liked
to show her, and then with a sigh went to the telephone
office and waited two hours till he got a connection
through to her house, just to tell her how
sorry he was that he could not come up as he had
expected and take that ride with her that she had
promised in her last letter. Somehow it comforted
him to hear her voice. She had asked if there would
be no lifting of the quarantine before they left, no
opportunity to meet him somewhere and say good-bye,
and he promised that he would let her know if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
any such chance came; but he had little hope, for
company after company were being sent away in
the troop trains now, hour after hour, and he might
be taken any minute.
</p>
<p>Then one day he called her up and told her that
the next Saturday and Sunday the camp was to be
thrown open to visitors, and if she could come down
with his mother he would meet them at the Hostess&#8217;
House and they could spend the day together. Ruth
promptly accepted the invitation and promised to
arrange it all with his mother and take the first train
down Saturday morning. After he had hung up
the receiver and paid his bill he walked away from
the little telephone headquarters in a daze of joy.
She had promised to come! For one whole day he
would have her to himself! She was willing to come
with his mother! Then as he passed the officers&#8217;
headquarters it occurred to him that perhaps she
had other interests in coming to camp than just to
see him, and he frowned in the darkness and his
heart burned hot within him. What if they should
meet Wainwright! How the day would be spoiled!
</p>
<p>With this trouble on his mind he went quite
early in the morning down as near to the little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
trolley station as he could get, for since the quarantine
had been put on no soldiers without a special
pass were allowed beyond a certain point, which was
roped off about the trolley station. Sadly, Cameron
took his place in the front rank, and stood with
folded arms to wait. He knew he would have some
time to stand before he could look for his guests,
but the crowd was always so great at the train times
that it was well to get a good place early. So he
stood and thought his sad thoughts, almost wishing
he had not asked them to come, as he realized more
and more what unpleasantness might arise in case
Wainwright should find out who were his guests.
He was sure that the lieutenant was not above sending
him away on a foolish errand, or getting him
into a humiliating situation before his friends.
</p>
<p>As he stood thus going over the situation and
trying to plan how he might spirit his guests away
to some pleasant spot where Wainwright would not
be likely to penetrate, he heard the pompous voice
of the lieutenant himself, and slipping behind a
comrade turned his face away so that he would not
be recognized.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I got special leave for three days!&#8221; proclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the satisfied voice, and Cameron&#8217;s heart
bounded up so joyously that he would have almost
been willing then and there to put aside his vow not
to salute him, and throw his arms about his enemy.
Going away for three days. That meant two
things! First that Wainwright would not have to
be thought of in making his plans, and second that
they were evidently not going to move before Wainwright
got back. They surely would not have
given him leave if the company was to be sent away
that day. A third exultant thought followed;
Wainwright was going home presumably to see
Ruth and Ruth would not be there! Perhaps, oh
<i>perhaps</i> he might be able to persuade her and his
mother to stay over Sunday! He hardly dared to
hope, however, for Ruth Macdonald might think
it presumptuous in him to suggest it, and again she
might wish to go home to meet Wainwright. And,
too, where could they sleep if they did stay. It was
hopeless, of course. They would have to go back to
Baltimore or to Washington for the night and that
would be a hard jaunt.
</p>
<p>However, Ruth Macdonald had thought of such
a possibility herself, and when she and Mrs. Cameron
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
stepped down from the Philadelphia train at
the small country station that had suddenly become
an important point because of the great camp that
had sprung up within a stone&#8217;s throw of it, she
looked around enquiringly at the little cottage
homes in sight and said to her companion:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be very dreadful in us to discover if
there is some place here where we could stay over
night in case John&#8217;s company does not go just yet
and we find we would be allowed to see him again
on Sunday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew by the sudden lighting of the mother&#8217;s
wistful face that she had read aright the sighs half
stifled that she had heard on the train when the
mother had thought she was not noticing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you suppose we could stay?&#8221; The
voice was full of yearning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can find out, at least. Anyhow, I&#8217;m
going in here to see whether they would take us in
case we could. It looks like a nice neat place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth pulled open the gate, ran up the steps of
the pleasant porch shaded with climbing roses, and
knocked timidly at the open door.
</p>
<p>A broad, somewhat frowsy woman appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
and surveyed her coolly with that apprising glance
that a native often gives to a stranger; took in the
elegant simplicity of her quiet expensive gown and
hat, lingering with a jealous glance on the exquisite
hand bag she carried, then replied apathetically to
Ruth&#8217;s question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re all full. We ain&#8217;t got any room.
You might try down to the Salvation Army Hut.
They got a few rooms down there. It&#8217;s just been
built. They might take you in. It&#8217;s down the road
a piece, that green building to the right. You can&#8217;t
miss it. You&#8217;ll see the sign.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth caught her breath, thanked her and hastened
back to her companion. Salvation Army!
That was eccentric, queer, but it would be perfectly
respectable! Or would it? Would Aunt Rhoda
disapprove very much? Somehow the Salvation
Army was associated in her mind with slums and
drunkards. But, at least, they might be able to
direct her to a respectable place.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cameron, too, looked dubious. This having
a society girl to chaperone was new business for
her. She had never thought much about it, but
somehow she would hardly have associated the Salvation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Army with the Macdonald family in any
way. She paused and looked doubtfully at the unpretentious
little one-story building that stretched
away capaciously and unostentatiously from the
grassy roadside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Salvation Army</span>&#8221; arose in bold inviting
letters from the roof, and &#8220;Ice Cold Lemonade&#8221;
beckoned from a sign on the neat screen door. Ruth
was a bit excited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in!&#8221; she declared and stepped
within the door, Mrs. Cameron following half
fearfully.
</p>
<p>The room which they entered was long and
clean and pleasant. Simple white curtains draped
the windows, many rush-bottomed big rocking
chairs were scattered about, a long desk or table ran
along one side of the room with writing materials,
a piano stood open with music on its rack, and
shelves of books and magazines filled the front wall.
</p>
<p>Beyond the piano were half a dozen little tables,
white topped and ready for a hungry guest. At
the back a counter ran the width of the room, with
sandwiches and pies under glass covers, and a bright
coffee urn steaming suggestively at one end. Behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
it through an open door was a view of the
kitchen, neat, handy, crude, but all quite clean, and
through this door stepped a sweet-faced woman,
wiping her hands on her gingham apron and coming
toward them with a smile of welcome as if they
were expected guests. It was all so primitive, and
yet there was something about it that bore the dignity
of refinement, and puzzled this girl from her
sheltered home. She was almost embarrassed to
make her enquiry, but the hearty response put her
quite at her ease, as if she had asked a great favor
of another lady in a time of stress:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, but our rooms are all taken,&#8221;
the woman waved a slender hand toward the long
side of the room and Ruth noticed for the first time
that a low partition ran the length of the room at
one side with doors. Mechanically she counted
them, eight of them, neat, gray-painted doors.
Could these be rooms? How interesting! She had
a wild desire to see inside them. Rooms! They
were more like little stalls, for the partitions did
not reach all the way to the ceiling. A vision of
her own spacious apartment at home came floating
in vague contrast. Then one of the doors opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
her opened as its occupant, a quiet little elderly
woman, came out, and she had a brief glimpse of
the white curtained window, the white draped comfortable
looking bed, a row of calico curtained hooks
on the wall, and a speck of a wash stand with tin
pitcher and basin in the corner, all as clean and new
as the rest of the place. She swiftly decided to stay
here if there was any chance. Another look at the
sweet face of the presiding woman who was trying
to make them understand how crowded everything
was, and how many mothers there were with sons
who were going that night or the next, and who
wanted to be near them, determined her. She was
saying there was just a chance in case a certain
mother from Boston who had written her did not
arrive at five o&#8217;clock:
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we ought not to take a chance,&#8221; said
Cameron&#8217;s mother, looking at the eager faced girl
with a cautious wistfulness. &#8220;What could we do
if night came and we had no place to stay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth cast her eyes about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we sit in a couple of those rocking
chairs all night?&#8221; she asked eagerly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>The Salvation Army woman laughed affectionately
as if she had found a kindred spirit:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, dearie, I could give you a couple of cots
out here in the dining room if you didn&#8217;t mind. I
wouldn&#8217;t have pillows, but I think I could get you
some blankets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said Ruth triumphantly before
Mrs. Cameron could protest, and went away
feeling that she had a new friend in the wise sweet
Salvation Army woman. In five minutes more
they were seated in the trolley on their way into
the camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid your people would not like you to
stay in such a place,&#8221; began Mrs. Cameron dubiously,
though her eyes shone with a light that belied
her words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Ruth with a bewildering
smile, &#8220;it is as clean as a pin and I&#8217;m very much
excited about staying there. It will be an adventure.
I&#8217;ve never known much about the Salvation
Army before, except that they are supposed to be
very good people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be some rough characters&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess they can&#8217;t hurt us with that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
good woman around, and anyhow, you&#8217;re going to
stay till your son goes!&#8221; laughingly declared Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see what John says,&#8221; said his
mother with a sigh, &#8220;I can&#8217;t let you do anything&mdash;questionable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Mrs. Cameron,&#8221; pleaded Ruth, &#8220;let
us forget things like that this trip and just have a
happy time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mother smiled, sadly, wistfully, through a
mist of tears. She could not help thinking how
wonderful it would have been if there had been no
war and her dear boy could have had this sweet
wholesome girl for a friend.

<h2>XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>The sun was shining gloriously when the two
stepped from the trolley at the little camp station
and looked bewildered about them at the swarms
of uniforms and boyish faces, searching for their
one. They walked through the long lane lined with
soldiers, held back by the great rope and guarded
by Military Police. Each crowding eager soldier
had an air of expectancy upon him, a silence upon
him that showed the realization of the parting that
was soon to be. In many faces deep disappointment
was growing as the expected ones did not
arrive. Ruth&#8217;s throat was filled with oppression
and tears as she looked about and suddenly felt the
grip of war, and realized that all these thousands
were bearing this bitterness of parting, perhaps forever.
Death stalking up and down a battlefield,
waiting to take his pick of them! This was the
picture that flashed before her shrinking eyes.
</p>
<p>It was almost like a solemn ceremony, this walking
down the lane of silent waiting soldiers, to be
claimed by their one. It seemed to bring the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
young people nearer in heart than they had ever
been before, when at the end of the line Cameron
met them with a salute, kissed his mother, and then
turned to Ruth and took her hand with an earnest
grave look of deep pleasure in his eyes.
</p>
<p>He led them up under the big trees in front of
the Hostess&#8217; House while all around were hushed
voices, and teary eyes. That first moment of meeting
was the saddest and the quietest of the day with
everybody, except the last parting hour when mute
grief sat unchecked upon every face, and no one
stopped to notice if any man were watching, but
just lived out his real heart self, and showed his
mother or his sister or his sweetheart how much he
loved and suffered.
</p>
<p>That was a day which all the little painted butterflies
of temptation should have been made to
witness. There were no painted ladies coming
through the gates that day. This was no time for
friendships like that. Death was calling, and the
deep realities of life stood out and demanded
attention.
</p>
<p>The whole thing was unlike anything Ruth had
ever witnessed before. It was a new world. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
as if the old conventions which had heretofore
hedged her life were dropped like a garment revealing
life as it really was, and every one walked
unashamed, because the great sorrow and need of
all had obliterated the little petty rules of life, and
small passions were laid aside, while hearts throbbed
in a common cause.
</p>
<p>He waited on them like a prince, seeming to
anticipate every need, and smooth every annoyance.
He led them away from the throng to the quiet hillside
above the camp where spring had set her dainty
foot-print. He spread down his thick army blanket
for them to sit upon and they held sweet converse
for an hour or two. He told them of camp life and
what was expected to be when they started over,
and when they reached the other side.
</p>
<p>His mother was brave and sensible. Sometimes
the tears would brim over at some suggestion of
what her boy was soon to bear or do, but she wore a
smile as courageous and sweet as any saint could
wear. The boy saw and grew tender over it. A
bird came and sang over their heads, and the moment
was sweet with springing things and quiet
with the brooding tenderness of parting that hung
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
over the busy camp. Ruth had one awful moment
of adjustment when she tried to think how her aunt
Rhoda would look if she could see her now; then
she threw the whole thing to the winds and resolved
to enjoy the day. She saw that while the conventions
by which she had been reared were a good
thing in general, perhaps, they certainly were not
meant to hamper or hinder the true and natural
life of the heart, or, if they were, they were not
<i>good</i> things; and she entered into the moment with
her full sympathy. Perhaps Aunt Rhoda would not
understand, but the girl she had brought up knew
that it was good to be here. Her aunt was away from
home with an invalid friend on a short trip so there
had been no one to question Ruth&#8217;s movements
when she decided to run down to Washington with
a &#8220;friend from the Red Cross&#8221; and incidentally
visit the camp a little while.
</p>
<p>He had them over the camp by and by, to the
trenches and dummies, and all the paraphernalia
of war preparation. Then they went back to the
Hostess&#8217; House and fell into line to get dinner. As
Cameron stood looking down at Ruth in the
crowded line in the democratic way which was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
only way there was, it came over them both how
strange and wonderful it was that they two who
had seen each other so little in their lives and who
had come from such widely separated social circles
should be there together in that beautiful intimacy.
It came to them both at once and flashed its thought
from one pair of eyes to the other and back again.
Cameron looked deep into her thoughts then for a
moment to find out if there was a shadow of mortification
or dismay in her face; but though she
flushed consciously her sweet true eyes gave back
only the pleasure she was feeling, and her real enjoyment
of the day. Then instantly each of them
felt that another crisis had been passed in their
friendship, another something unseen and beautiful
had happened that made this moment most
precious&mdash;one never to be forgotten no matter what
happened in the future, something they would not
have missed for any other experience.
</p>
<p>It was Ruth who announced suddenly, late in
the afternoon, during a silence in which each one
was thinking how fast the day was going:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that we were going to stay
over Sunday?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s face blazed with joyful light:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;do you mean
it? I&#8217;ve been trying to get courage all day to suggest
it, only I don&#8217;t know of any place this side
of Washington or Baltimore where you can be comfortable,
and I hate to think of you hunting around
a strange city late at night for accommodations. If
I could only get out to go with you&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary,&#8221; said Ruth quickly, &#8220;we
have our accommodations all arranged for. Your
mother and I planned it all out before we came.
But are you sure we can get into camp to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m almost certain we can get you passes
by going up to officers&#8217; headquarters and applying.
A fellow in our company told me this morning he
had permission for his mother and sister to come in
to-morrow. And we are not likely to leave before
Monday now, for this morning our lieutenant went
away and I heard him say he had a three days&#8217; leave.
They wouldn&#8217;t have given him that if they expected
to send us before he got back, at least not unless
they recalled him&mdash;they might do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the lieutenant that you called a &#8216;mess&#8217;
the other day?&#8221; asked Ruth with twinkling eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Cameron turning a keen, startled
glance at her, and wondering what she would say if
she knew it was Wainwright he meant.
</p>
<p>But she answered demurely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s away, is he? I&#8217;m glad. I was hoping
he would be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Cameron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought he might be in the way,&#8221; she
smiled, and changed the subject, calling attention
to the meadow lark who was trilling out his little
ecstasy in the tall tree over their head.
</p>
<p>Cameron gave one glance at the bird and then
brought his gaze back to the sweet upturned face
beside him, his soul thrilling with the wonder of it
that she should be there with him!
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told me where you have
arranged to stay. Is it Baltimore or Washington?
I must look up your trains. I hope you will be
able to stay as late as possible. They&#8217;re not putting
people out of camp until eight o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely!&#8221; said Ruth with the eagerness of a
child. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll stay till the very last trolley.
We&#8217;re not going to either Baltimore or Washington.
We&#8217;re staying right near the camp entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
in that little town at the station where we landed, I
don&#8217;t remember what you call it. We got accommodations
this morning before we came into camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where?&#8221; asked Cameron anxiously.
&#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s respectable? I&#8217;m afraid there
isn&#8217;t any place there that would do at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes there is,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;It&#8217;s the Salvation
Army &#8216;Hut,&#8217; they called it, but it looks more
like a barracks, and there&#8217;s the dearest little woman
in charge!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;John, I&#8217;m afraid it isn&#8217;t the right thing to let
her do it!&#8221; put in his mother anxiously. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid her aunt wouldn&#8217;t like it at all, and I&#8217;m sure
she won&#8217;t be comfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall <i>love</i> it!&#8221; said Ruth happily, &#8220;and my
aunt will never know anything about it. As for
comfort, I&#8217;ll be as comfortable as you are, my dear
lady, and I&#8217;m sure you wouldn&#8217;t let comfort stand
in the way of being with your boy.&#8221; She smiled
her sweet little triumph that brought tears to the
eyes of the mother; and Cameron gave her a blinding
look of gratitude and adoration. So she carried
her way.
</p>
<p>Cameron protested no more, but quietly enquired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
at the Hostess&#8217; House if the place was all
right, and when he put them on the car at eight
o&#8217;clock he gave Ruth&#8217;s hand a lingering pressure,
and said in a low tone that only she could hear,
with a look that carried its meaning to her heart:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never forget that you did this for my
mother&mdash;and me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two felt almost light-hearted in comparison
to their fellow travellers, because they had a short
reprieve before they would have to say good-bye.
But Ruth sat looking about her, at the sad-eyed
girls and women who had just parted from their
husbands and sons and sweethearts, and who were
most of them weeping, and felt anew the great burden
of the universal sorrow upon her. She wondered
how God could stand it. The old human
question that wonders how God can stand the great
agonies of life that have to come to cure the world
of its sin, and never wonders how God can stand the
sin! She felt as if she must somehow find God and
plead with Him not to do it, and again there came
that longing to her soul, if she only knew God intimately!
Cameron&#8217;s question recurred to her
thoughts, &#8220;<i>Could</i> anyone on this earth know God?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Had anyone ever known Him? Would the Bible
say anything about it?&#8221; She resolved to read it
through and find out.
</p>
<p>The brief ride brought them suddenly into a
new and to Ruth somewhat startling environment.
</p>
<p>As they followed the grassy path from the station
to their abiding place two little boys in full
military uniform appeared out of the tall grass of
the meadows, one as a private, the other as an officer.
The small private saluted the officer with precision
and marched on, turning after a few steps to call
back, &#8220;Mother said we might sleep in the tent to-night!
The rooms are all full.&#8221; The older boy
gave a whoop of delight and bounded back toward
the building with a most unofficer-like walk, and
both disappeared inside the door. A tiny khaki
dog-tent was set up in the grass by the back door,
and in a moment more the two young soldiers
emerged from the back door with blankets and disappeared
under the brown roof with a zest that
showed it was no hardship to them to camp out for
the night.
</p>
<p>There were lights in the long pleasant room, and
people. Two soldiers with their girls were eating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
ice cream at the little tables, and around the piano
a group of officers and their wives was gathered
singing ragtime. Ruth&#8217;s quick glance told her
they were not the kind she cared for, and&mdash;how
could people who were about to part, perhaps forever,
stand there and sing such abominable nonsense!
Yet&mdash;perhaps it was their way of being
brave to the last. But she wished they would go.
</p>
<p>The sweet-faced woman of the morning was
busy behind the counter and presently she saw them
and came forward:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! I hoped there would be a room,
but that woman from Boston came. I can only
give you cots out here, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cameron looked around in a half-frightened
manner, but Ruth smiled airily and said that
would be all right.
</p>
<p>They settled down in the corner between the
writing table and book case and began to read, for
it was obvious that they could not retire at present.
</p>
<p>The little boys came running through and the
officers corralled them and clamored for them to
sing. Without any coaxing they stood up together
and sang, and their voices were sweet as birds as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
they piped out the words of a popular song, one
singing alto, the little one taking the high soprano.
Ruth put down her book and listened, wondering at
the lovely expressions on the two small faces. They
made her think of the baby-seraphs in Michael
Angelo&#8217;s pictures. Presently they burst into a religious
song with as much gusto as they had sung
the ragtime. They were utterly without self-consciousness,
and sang with the fervor of a preacher.
Yet they were regular boys, for presently when
they were released they went to turning hand
springs and had a rough and tumble scuffle in the
corner till their mother called them to order.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes more the noisy officers and
their wives parted, the men striding off into the
night with a last word about the possibility of unexpected
orders coming, and a promise to wink a flash
light out of the car window as the troop train went
by in case they went out that night. The wives
went into one of the little stall-rooms and compared
notes about their own feelings and the probability
of the &mdash;&mdash;Nth Division leaving before Monday.
</p>
<p>Then the head of the house appeared with a
Bible under his arm humming a hymn. He cast a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
keen pleasant glance at the two strangers in the
corner, and gave a cheery word to his wife in answer
to her question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we had a great meeting to-night. A hundred
and twenty men raised their hands as wanting
to decide for Christ, and two came forward to be
prayed for. It was a blessed time. I wish the boys
had been over there to sing. The meeting was in
the big Y.M.C.A. auditorium. Has Captain Hawley
gone yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221; His wife&#8217;s voice was lowered. She
motioned toward one of the eight gray doors, and
her husband nodded sadly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He goes at midnight, you know. Poor little
woman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then the door opened and a young soldier
came out, followed by his wife, looking little and
pathetic with great dark hollows under her eyes,
and a forced smile on her trembling lips.
</p>
<p>The soldier came over and took the hand of the
Salvation Army woman:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going out to-night, Mother. I
want to thank you for all you&#8217;ve done for my little
girl&#8221;&mdash;looking toward his wife&mdash;&#8220;and I won&#8217;t forget
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
all the good things you&#8217;ve done for <i>me</i>, and the
sermons you&#8217;ve preached; and when I get over there
I&#8217;m going to try to live right and keep all my
promises. I want you to pray for me that I may
be true. I shall never cease to thank the Lord that
I knew you two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Salvationists shook hands earnestly with
him, and promised to pray for him, and then he
turned to the children:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Dicky, I shan&#8217;t forget the songs
you&#8217;ve sung. I&#8217;ll hear them sometimes when I
get over there in battle, and they&#8217;ll help to keep
me true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Dicky, not content with a hand shake
swarmed up the leg and back of his tall friend as if
he had been a tree, and whispered in a loud confidential
child-whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a goin&#8217; to pray fer you, too, Cap&#8217;n Hawley.
God bless you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The grown-up phrases on the childish lips
amused Ruth. She watched the little boy as he
lifted his beautiful serious face to the responsive
look of the stranger, and marvelled. Here was no
parrot-like repetition of word she had heard oft
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
repeated by his elders; the boy was talking a native
tongue, and speaking of things that were real to
him. There was no assumption of godliness nor
conceit, no holier-than-thou smirk about the child.
It was all sincere, as a boy would promise to speak
to his own father about a friend&#8217;s need. It touched
Ruth and tears sprang to her eyes.
</p>
<p>All the doubts she had had about the respectability
of the place had vanished long ago. There
might be all kinds of people coming and going, but
there was a holy influence here which made it a
refuge for anyone, and she felt quite safe about
sleeping in the great barn-like room so open. It was
as if they had happened on some saint&#8217;s abode and
been made welcome in their extremity.
</p>
<p>Presently, one by one the inmates of the rooms
came in and retired. Then the cots were brought out
and set up, little simple affairs of canvas and steel
rods, put together in a twinkling, and very inviting
to the two weary women after the long day. The
cheery proprietor called out, &#8220;Mrs. Brown, haven&#8217;t
you an extra blanket in your room?&#8221; and a pleasant
voice responded promptly, &#8220;Yes, do you
want it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Throw it over then, please. A couple of ladies
hadn&#8217;t any place to go. Anybody else got one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A great gray blanket came flying over the top
of the partition, and down the line another voice
called: &#8220;I have one I don&#8217;t need!&#8221; and a white
blanket with pink stripes followed, both caught by
the Salvationist, and spread upon the little cots.
Then the lights were turned out one by one and
there in the shelter of the tall piano, curtained by
the darkness the two lay down.
</p>
<p>Ruth was so interested in it all and so filled with
the humor and the strangeness of her situation that
tired as she was she could not sleep for a long time.
</p>
<p>The house settled slowly to quiet. The proprietor
and his wife talked comfortably about the
duties of the next day, called some directions to
the two boys in the puppy tent, soothed their mosquito
bites with a lotion and got them another
blanket. The woman who helped in the kitchen
complained about not having enough supplies for
morning, and that contingency was arranged for,
all in a patient, earnest way and in the same tone in
which they talked about the meetings. They discussed
their own boy, evidently the brother of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
small boys, who had apparently just sailed for
France as a soldier a few days before, and whom the
wife had gone to New York to see off, and they
commended him to their Christ in little low sentences
of reassurance to each other. Ruth could not
help but hear much that was said, for the rooms
were all open to sounds, and these good people apparently
had nothing to hide. They spoke as if all
their household were one great family, equally interested
in one another, equally suffering and patient
in the necessities of this awful war.
</p>
<p>In another tiny room the Y.M.C.A. man who
had been the last to come in talked in low tones
with his wife, telling her in tender, loving tones
what to do about a number of things after he
was gone.
</p>
<p>In a room quite near there were soft sounds as
of suppressed weeping. Something made Ruth
sure it was the mother who had been spoken of
earlier in the evening as having come all the way
from Texas and arrived too late to bid her boy
good-bye.
</p>
<p>Now and again the sound of a troop train stirred
her heart to untold depths. There is something so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
weird and sorrowful about its going, as if the very
engine sympathized, screaming its sorrow through
the night. Ruth felt she never would forget that
sound. Out there in the dark Cameron might be
even then slipping past them out into the great
future. She wished she could dare ask that sweet
faced woman, or that dear little boy to pray for
<i>him</i>. Maybe she would next day.
</p>
<p>The two officer&#8217;s wives seemed to sit up in bed
and watch the train. They had discovered a flash
light, and were counting the signals, and quite excited.
Ruth&#8217;s heart ached for them. It was a
peculiarity of this trip that she found her heart
going out to others so much more than it had ever
gone before. She was not thinking of her own pain,
although she knew it was there, but of the pain of
the world.
</p>
<p>Her body lying on the strange hard cot ached
with weariness in unaccustomed places, yet she
stretched and nestled upon the tan canvas with
satisfaction. She was sharing to a certain extent
the hardships of the soldiers&mdash;the hardship of one
soldier whose privations hurt her deeply. It was
good to have to suffer&mdash;with him. Where was God?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Did He care? Was He in this queer little hostel?
Might she ask Him now to set a guard over Cameron
and let him find the help he needed wherewith
to go to meet Death, if Death he must meet?
</p>
<p>She laid her hands together as a little child
might do and with wide-open eyes staring into the
dark of the high ceiling she whispered from her
heart: &#8220;Oh God, help&mdash;<i>us</i>&mdash;to find <i>you</i>!&#8221; and unconsciously
she, too, set her soul on the search
that night.
</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes a great peace and sense
of safety came over her.
</p>
<p>Outside on the road a company of late soldiers,
coming home from leave noised by. Some of them
were drunk, and wrangling or singing, and a sense
of their pitiful need of God came over her as she
sank into a deep sleep.
</p>

<h2>XV</h2>
</div>

<p>She was awakened by the rattling of the pots
and pans in the tiny kitchen. She sat up startled
and looked about her. It was very early. The
first sunlight was streaming redly through the
window screens, and the freshness of the morning
was everywhere, for all the windows were wide
open. The stillness of the country, broken only by
the joyous chorus of the birds, struck her as a wonderful
thing. She lay down again and closed her
eyes to listen. Music with the scent of clover! The
cheery little home noises in the kitchen seemed a
pleasant background for the peace of the Sabbath
morning. It was so new and strange. Then came
the thought of camp and the anticipation of the
day, with the sharp pang at the memory that perhaps
even now Cameron was gone. Orders were
so uncertain. In the army a man must be ready to
move at a moment&#8217;s notice. What if while she
slept he had passed by on one of those terrible
troop trains!
</p>
<p>She sat up again and began to put her hair into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
order and make herself presentable. He had
promised that if such a thing as a sudden move
should occur he would throw out an old envelope
with his name written on it as they passed by the
hut, and she meant to go out to that railroad track
and make a thorough search before the general
public were up.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Cameron was still sleeping soundly, one
work-worn hand partly shading her face. Ruth
knew instinctively that she must have been weeping
in the night. In the early morning dawn she
drooped on the hard little cot in a crumpled heap,
and the girl&#8217;s heart ached for her sorrow.
</p>
<p>Ruth stole into the kitchen to ask for water to
wash her face:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the pleasant-faced woman
who was making coffee and frying bacon, &#8220;but the
wash basins are all gone; we&#8217;ve had so many folks
come in. But you can have this pail. I just got
this water for myself and I&#8217;ll let you have it and
I&#8217;ll get some more. You see, the water pipes aren&#8217;t
put in the building yet and we have to go down the
road quite a piece to get any. This is all there was
left last night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>She handed Ruth a two-gallon galvanized tin
bucket containing a couple of inches of water, obviously
clean, and added a brief towel to the toilet
arrangements.
</p>
<p>Ruth beat a hasty retreat back to the shelter of
the piano with her collection, fearing lest mirth
would get the better of her. She could not help
thinking how her aunt would look if she could see
her washing her face in this pittance of water in the
bottom of the great big bucket.
</p>
<p>But Ruth Macdonald was adaptable in spite of
her upbringing. She managed to make a most
pleasing toilet in spite of the paucity of water, and
then went back to the kitchen with the bucket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will show me where you get the water
I&#8217;ll go for some more,&#8221; she offered, anxious for an
excuse to get out and explore the track.
</p>
<p>The woman in the kitchen was not abashed at
the offer. She accepted the suggestion as a matter
of course, taking for granted the same helpful spirit
that seemed to pervade all the people around the
place. It did not seem to strike her as anything
strange that this young woman should be willing
to go for water. She was not giving attention to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
details like clothes and handbags, and neither wealth
nor social station belonged to her scheme of life. So
she smilingly gave the directions to the pump and
went on breaking nice brown eggs into a big yellow
bowl. Ruth wished she could stay and watch, it
looked so interesting.
</p>
<p>She took the pail and slipped out the back door,
but before she went in search of water she hurried
down to the railroad track and scanned it for several
rods either way, carefully examining each bit
of paper, her breath held in suspense as she turned
over an envelope or scrap of paper, lest it might
bear his name. At last with a glad look backward
to be sure she had missed nothing, she hurried up
the bank and took her way down the grassy path
toward the pump, satisfied that Cameron had not
yet left the camp.
</p>
<p>It was a lovely summer morning, and the quietness
of the country struck her as never before. The
wild roses shimmered along the roadside in the early
sun, and bees and butterflies were busy about their
own affairs. It seemed such a lovely world if it
only had not been for <i>war</i>. How could God bear
it! She lifted her eyes to the deep blue of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
sky, where little clouds floated lazily, like lovely
aviators out for pleasure. Was God up there? If
she might only find Him. What did it all mean,
anyway? Did He really care for individuals?
</p>
<p>It was all such a new experience, the village
pump, and the few early stragglers watching her
curiously from the station platform. A couple of
grave soldiers hurried by, and the pang of what
was to come shot through her heart. The thought
of the day was full of mingled joy and sorrow.
</p>
<p>They ate a simple little breakfast, good coffee,
toast and fried eggs. Ruth wondered why it tasted
so good amid such primitive surroundings; yet
everything was so clean and tidy, though coarse and
plain. When they went to pay their bill the proprietor
said their beds would be only twenty-five
cents apiece because they had had no pillow. If
they had had a pillow he would have had to charge
them fifty cents. The food was fabulously cheap.
They looked around and wondered how it could be
done. It was obvious that no tips would be received,
and that money was no consideration. In
fact, the man told them his orders were merely to
pay expenses. He gave them a parting word of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
good cheer, and promised to try and make them
more comfortable if they wanted to return that
night, and so they started out for camp. Ruth was
silent and thoughtful. She was wishing she had
had the boldness to ask this quaint Christian man
some of the questions that troubled her. He looked
as if he knew God, and she felt as if he might be able
to make some things plain to her. But her life had
been so hedged about by conventionalities that it
seemed an impossible thing to her to open her lips on
the subject to any living being&mdash;unless it might be
to John Cameron. It was queer how they two had
grown together in the last few months. Why could
they not have known one another before?
</p>
<p>Then there came a vision of what her aunt might
have thought, and possible objections that might
have come up if they had been intimate friends
earlier. In fact, that, too, seemed practically to
have been an impossibility. How had the war torn
away the veil from foolish laws of social rank and
station! Never again could she submit to much of
the system that had been the foundation of her life
so far. Somehow she must find a way to tear her
spirit free from things that were not real. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
thought of the social activities that would face her
at home under the guise of patriotism turned her
soul sick with loathing. When she went back home
after he was gone she would find a way to do something
real in the world that would make for righteousness
and peace somehow. Knitting and
dancing with lonesome soldiers did not satisfy her.
</p>
<p>That was a wonderful day and they made the
most of every hour, realizing that it would probably
be the last day they had together for many a long
month or year.
</p>
<p>In the morning they stepped into the great auditorium
and attended a Y.M.C.A. service for an
hour, but their hearts were so full, and they all felt
so keenly that this day was to be the real farewell,
and they could not spare a moment of it, that presently
they slipped away to the quiet of the woods
once more, for it was hard to listen to the music and
keep the tears back. Mrs. Cameron especially
found it impossible to keep her composure.
</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon she went into the Hostess&#8217;
House to lie down in the rest room for a few
minutes, and sent the two young people off for a
walk by themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>Cameron took Ruth to the log in the woods and
showed her his little Testament and the covenant he
had signed. Then they opened their hearts together
about the eternal things of life; shyly, at first, and
then with the assurance that sympathy brings.
Cameron told her that he was trying to find God,
and Ruth told him about their experiences the night
before. She also shyly promised that she would
pray for him, although she had seldom until lately
done very much real praying for herself.
</p>
<p>It was a beautiful hour wherein they travelled
miles in their friendship; an hour in which their
souls came close while they sat on the log under the
trees with long silences in the intervals of their talk.
</p>
<p>It was whispered at the barracks that evening at
five when Cameron went back for &#8220;Retreat&#8221; that
this was the last night. They would move in the
morning surely, perhaps before. He hurried back
to the Hostess&#8217; House where he had left his guests
to order the supper for all, feeling that he must
make the most of every minute.
</p>
<p>Passing the officers&#8217; headquarters he heard the
raucous laugh of Wainwright, and caught a glimpse
of his fat head and neck through a window. His
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
heart sank! Wainwright was back! Then he had
been sent for, and they must be going that night!
</p>
<p>He fled to the Hostess&#8217; House and was silent
and distraught as he ate his supper. Suppose Wainwright
should come in while they were there and
see Ruth and spoil those last few minutes together?
The thought was unbearable.
</p>
<p>Nobody wanted much supper and they wandered
outside in the soft evening air. There was a
hushed sorrow over everything. Even the roughest
soldiers were not ashamed of tears. Little faded
mothers clung to big burly sons, and their sons
smoothed their gray hair awkwardly and were not
ashamed. A pair of lovers sat at the foot of a tree
hand in hand and no one looked at them, except in
sympathy. There were partings everywhere. A
few wives with little children in their arms were
writing down hurried directions and receiving a bit
of money; but most desolate of all was the row of
lads lined up near the station whose friends were
gone, or had not come at all, and who had to stand
and endure the woe of others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we <i>walk</i> out of camp?&#8221; asked Ruth
suddenly. &#8220;Must we go on that awful trolley?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
Last night everybody was weeping. I wanted to
weep, too. It is only a few steps from the end of
camp to our quarters. Or is it too far for you, Mrs.
Cameron?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is too far to-night so I may be with
my boy one hour longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must start at once,&#8221; said Cameron,
&#8220;there is barely time to reach the outskirts before
the hour when all visitors must be out of camp. It
is over three miles, mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can walk it if Ruth can,&#8221; said the mother
smiling bravely.
</p>
<p>He drew an arm of each within his own and
started off, glad to be out of Wainwright&#8217;s neighborhood,
gladder still to have a little longer with
those he loved.
</p>
<p>Out through the deserted streets they passed,
where empty barracks were being prepared for the
next draft men; past the Tank Headquarters and
the colored barracks, the storehouses and more barracks
just emptied that afternoon into troop trains;
out beyond the great laundry and on up the cinder
road to the top of the hill and the end of the way.
</p>
<p>There at last, in sight of the Military Police,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
pacing back and forth at the entrance to camp, with
the twinkling lights of the village beyond, and the
long wooded road winding back to camp, they
paused to say good-bye. The cinder path and the
woods at its edge made a blot of greenish black
against a brilliant stormy sky. The sun was setting
like a ball of fire behind the trees, and some strange
freak of its rays formed a golden cross resting back
against the clouds, its base buried among the woods,
its cross bar rising brilliant against the black of a
thunder cloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;it is an omen!&#8221; They
looked and a great wonder and awe came upon
them. The Cross!
</p>
<p>Cameron looked back and then down at her
and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will lead you safely home,&#8221; she said softly
and laid her hand in his. He held her fingers close
for an instant and his eyes dared some of the things
his lips would never have spoken now even if they
two had been alone.
</p>
<p>The Military Police stepped up:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to stay out here to say good-bye.
You can come into the station right here and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
sit down. Or if your friends are going to the village
you may go with them, Comrade. I can trust you
to come back right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you!&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;That is the
kindest thing that has happened to me at this camp.
I wish I could avail myself of it, but I have barely
time to get back to the barracks within the hour
given me. Perhaps&mdash;&#8221; and he glanced anxiously
across the road toward the village. &#8220;Could you just
keep an eye out that my ladies reach the Salvation
Army Hut all right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said the big soldier heartily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
myself. I&#8217;m just going off duty and I&#8217;ll see them
safe to the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stepped a little away and gave an order to
his men, and so they said good-bye and watched
Cameron go down the road into the sunset with the
golden cross blazing above him as he walked lower
and lower down the hill into the shadow of the dark
woods and the thunder cloud. But brightly the
cross shone above him as long as they could see, and
just before he stepped into the darkness where the
road turned he paused, waved his hat, and so passed
on out of their sight.
</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
</div>

<p>The first night on the water was one of unspeakable
horror to Cameron. They had scarcely
begun to feel the roll of the waves before Captain
Wurtz manifested his true nature. At six o&#8217;clock
and broad daylight, he ordered the men below, had
them locked in, and all the port holes closed!
</p>
<p>The place was packed, the heat was unbearable,
the motion increasing all the time, and the air soon
became intolerable. In vain the men protested, and
begged for air. Their requests were all denied.
The captain trusted no man. He treated them as
if they were hounds. Wainwright stood by the captain&#8217;s
side, smoking the inevitable cigarette, his eyes
narrowly watching Cameron, when the order was
given; but no onlooker could have told from Cameron&#8217;s
well trained face whether he had heard or
not. Well he knew where those orders had originated,
and instantly he saw a series of like torments.
Wainwright had things in his own hands
for this voyage. Wurtz was his devoted slave. For
Wainwright had money, and used it freely with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
his captain, and Wainwright well knew how to
think up tortures. It was really the only thing in
which he was clever. And here again was an instance
of practice making perfect, for Wainwright
had done little else since his kindergarten days than
to think up trials for those who would not bow to
his peevish will. He seemed to be gifted in finding
out exactly what would be the finest kind of torture
for any given soul who happened to be his victim.
He had the mind of Nero and the spirit of a mean
little beast. The wonder, the great miracle was,
that he had not in some way discovered that Ruth
had been visiting the camp, and taken his revenge
before she left. This was the first thought that came
to Cameron when he found himself shut into the
murky atmosphere. The next thought was that
perhaps he had discovered it and this was the result.
He felt himself the Jonah for the company, and as
the dreadful hours went by would fain have cast
himself into the sea if there had been a possible
way of escape.
</p>
<p>It was not an American transport on which they
were sailing, and the captain was not responsible
for the food, but he might have refused to allow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
such meals to be served to his men if he had cared.
He did not care, that was the whole trouble. He
ate and drank, principally drank, and did whatever
Wainwright suggested. When a protest came up
to him he turned it down with a laugh, and said:
&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s good enough for a buck private,&#8221; and
went on with his dirty jokes.
</p>
<p>The supper that first night was abominable,
some unpleasant kind of meat cooked with cabbage,
and though they tried to eat it, many of them could
not keep it down. The ship rolled and the men
grew sick. The atmosphere became fetid. Each
moment seemed more impossible than the last.
There was no room to move, neither could one get
out and away. After supper the men lay down in
the only place there was to lie, two men on the tables,
two men on the benches each side, two men on the
floor between, and so on all over the cabin, packed
like eggs in a box.
</p>
<p>They sent a message to their captain begging
for air, but he only laughed, and sent word back
they would have air enough before they got through
with this war.
</p>
<p>The night wore on and Cameron lay on his scant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
piece of floor&mdash;he had given his bench to a sicker
man than himself&mdash;and tried to sleep. But sleep
did not visit his eyelids. He was thinking, thinking.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find God! I&#8217;m going to search for
Him with all my heart, and somehow I&#8217;m going to
find Him before I&#8217;m done. I may never come
home, but I&#8217;ll find God, anyhow! It&#8217;s the only
thing that makes life bearable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then would come a wave of hate for his enemy
and wipe out all other thoughts, and he would
wrestle in his heart with the desire to kill Wainwright&mdash;yes,
and the captain, too. As some poor
wretch near him would writhe and groan in agony
his rage would boil up anew, his fists would clench,
and he would half rise to go to the door and overpower
that guard! If only he could get up to where
the officers were enjoying themselves! Oh, to bring
them down here and bind them in this loathsome
atmosphere, feed them with this food, stifle them in
the dark with closed port holes! His brain was
fertile with thoughts of revenge. Then suddenly
across his memory would flash the words: &#8220;If with
all your heart ye seek Him,&#8221; and he would reach
out in longing: Oh, if he could find God, surely God
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
would stop a thing like this! Did God have no
power in His own earth?
</p>
<p>Slowly, painfully, the days dragged by, each
worse than the last. In the mornings the men must
go on deck whether they were sick or not, and must
stay there all day, no matter what the weather. If
they were wet they must dry out by the heat of their
bodies. There was no possibility of getting at their
kit bags, it was so crowded. No man was allowed
to open one. All they had was the little they carried
in their packs. How they lived through it was a
wonder, but live they did. Perhaps the worst torture
of all was the great round cork life preserver in
the form of a cushioned ring which they were obliged
to wear night and day. A man could never lie down
comfortably with it on, and if from sheer exhaustion
he fell asleep he awoke with his back aching tortures.
The meat and cabbage was varied twice by steamed
fish served in its scales, tails, fins, heads, and entrails
complete. All that they got which was really
eatable was a small bun served in the morning, and
boiled potatoes occasionally.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these hardships would have been
as nothing to Cameron if they had not represented
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
to him hate, pure and simple. He felt, and perhaps
justly, that if Wainwright had not wished to
make him suffer, these things would surely have
been mitigated.
</p>
<p>The day came at last when they stood on the
deck and watched the strange foreign shore draw
nearer. Cameron, stern and silent, stood apart from
the rest. For the moment his anger toward Wainwright
was forgotten, though he could hear the
swaggering tones from the deck above, and the
noisome laughter of Wurtz in response. Cameron
was looking into the face of the future, wondering
what it would mean for him. Out there was
the strange country. What did it hold for him?
Was God there? How he wanted God to go with
him and help him face the future!
</p>
<p>There was much delay in landing, and getting
ready to move. The men were weak from sickness
and long fasting. They tottered as they stood, but
they had to stand&mdash;unless they dropped. They
turned wan faces toward one another and tried to
smile. Their fine American pep was gone, hopelessly,
yet they grinned feebly now and then and
got off a weak little joke or two. For the most part
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
they glared when the officers came by&mdash;especially
two&mdash;those two. The wrath toward them had been
brewing long and deep as each man lay weltering
through those unbearable nights. Hardship they
could bear, and pain, and sickness&mdash;but tyranny
<i>never!</i>
</p>
<p>Someone had written a letter. It was not the
first. There had been others on ship board protesting
against their treatment. But this letter was a
warning to that captain and lieutenant. If they
ever led these men into battle <i>they</i> would be killed
before the battle began. It was signed by the company.
It had been a unanimous vote. Now as
they stood staring leadenly at the strange sights
about them, listening to the new jargon of the shore,
noting the quaint headdresses and wooden sabots
of the people with a fine scorn of indifference, they
thought of that letter in hard phrases of rage. And
bitterest of all were the thoughts of John Cameron
as he stood in his place awaiting orders.
</p>
<p>They were hungry, these men, and unfit, when
at last the order came to march, and they had to
hike it straight up a hill with a great pack on their
backs. It was not that they minded the packs or the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
hike or the hunger. It was the injustice of their
treatment that weighed upon them like a burden
that human nature could not bear. They had come
to lift such a burden from the backs of another
nation, and they had been treated like dogs all the
way over! Like the low rumbling of oncoming
thunder was the blackness of their countenances as
they marched up, up, and up into Brest. The sun
grew hot, and their knees wobbled under them from
sheer weakness; strong men when they started, who
were fine and fit, now faint like babies, yet with
spirits unbroken, and great vengeance in their
hearts. They would fight, oh they would fight, yes,
but they would see that captain out of the way first!
Here and there by the way some fell&mdash;the wonder
is they all did not&mdash;and had to be picked up by the
ambulances; and at last they had to be ordered to
stop and rest! They! Who had come over here to
flaunt their young strength in the face of the enemy!
<i>They</i> to fall <i>before the fight was begun</i>. This, too,
they laid up against their tyrant.
</p>
<p>But there was welcome for them, nevertheless.
Flowers and wreaths and bands of music met them
as they went through the town, and women and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
little children flung them kisses and threw blossoms
in their way. This revived somewhat the drooping
spirits with which they had gone forth, and when
they reached camp and got a decent meal they felt
better, and more reasonable. Still the bitterness
was there, against those two who had used their
power unworthily. That night, lying on a hard
little cot in camp Cameron tried to pray, his heart
full of longing for God, yet found the heavens as
brass, and could not find words to cry out, except in
bitterness. Somehow he did not feel he was getting
on at all in his search, and from sheer weariness and
discouragement he fell asleep at last.
</p>
<p>Three days and nights of rest they had and
then were packed into tiny freight cars with a space
so small that they had to take turns sitting down.
Men had to sleep sitting or standing, or wherever
they could find space to lie down. So they started
across France, three days and awful nights they
went, weary and sore and bitter still. But they
had air and they were better fed. Now and then
they could stand up and look out through a crack.
Once in a while a fellow could get space to stretch
out for a few minutes. Cameron awoke once and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
found feet all over him, feet even in his face. Yet
these things were what he had expected. He did
not whine. He was toughened for such experiences,
so were the men about him. The hardness merely
brought out their courage. They were getting their
spirits back now as they neared the real scene of
action. The old excitement and call to action were
creeping back into their blood. Now and then a
song would pipe out, or a much abused banjo or
mandolin would twang and bring forth their voices.
It was only when an officer walked by or mention
would be made of the captain or lieutenant that
their looks grew black again and they fell silent.
Injustice and tyranny, the things they had come
out to fight, that they would not forgive nor forget.
Their spirits were reviving but their hate was there.
</p>
<p>At last they detrained and marched into a
little town.
</p>
<p>This was France!
</p>
<p>Cameron looked about him in dismay. A
scramble of houses and barns, sort of two-in-one
affairs. Where was the beauty of France about
which he had read so often? Mud was everywhere.
The streets were deep with it, the ground was sodden,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
rain-soaked. It was raining even then. Sunny
France!
</p>
<p>It was in a barnyard deep in manure where
Cameron&#8217;s tent was set up. Little brown tents set
close together, their flies dovetailing so that more
could be put in a given space.
</p>
<p>Dog weary he strode over the stakes that held
them, and looked upon the place where he was to
sleep. Its floor was almost a foot deep in water!
Rank, ill smelling water! Pah! Was this intention
that he should have been billeted here? Some of
the men had dry places. Of course, it might have
just happened, but&mdash;well, what was the use. Here
he must sleep for he could not stand up any longer
or he would fall over. So he heaped up a pillow of
the muck, spread his blanket out and lay down. At
least his head would be high enough out of the water
so that he would not drown in his sleep, and with
his feet in water, and the cold ooze creeping slowly
through his heavy garments, he dropped immediately
into oblivion. There were no prayers that
night. His heart was full of hate. The barnyard
was in front of an old stone farm house, and in that
farm house were billeted the captain and his favorite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
first lieutenant. Cameron could hear his raucous
laugh and the clinking of the wine glasses, almost
the gurgle of the wine. The thought of Wainwright
was his last conscious one before he slept.
Was it of intention that he should have been put
here close by, where Wainwright could watch his
every move?
</p>
<p>As the days went by and real training began,
with French officers working them hard until they
were ready to drop at night, gradually Cameron
grew stolid. It seemed sometimes as if he had
always been here, splashing along in the mud,
soaked with rain, sleeping in muck at night, never
quite dry, never free from cold and discomfort,
never quite clean, always training, the boom of the
battle afar, but never getting there. Where was
the front? Why didn&#8217;t they get there and fight and
get done with it all?
</p>
<p>The rain poured down, day after day. Ammunition
trains rolled by. More men marched in, more
marched on, still they trained. It seemed eons since
he had bade Ruth and his mother good-bye that
night at the camp. No mail had come. Oh, if he
could just hear a word from home! If he only had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
her picture! They had taken some together at
camp and she had promised to have them developed
and send them, but they would probably never
reach him. And it were better if they did not.
Wainwright was censor. If he recognized the
writing nothing would ever reach him he was sure.
Still, Wainwright had nothing to do with the incoming
mail, only the outgoing. Well, Wainwright
should never censor his letters. He would find a
way to get letters out that Wainwright had never
censored, or he would never send any.
</p>
<p>But the days dragged by in rain and mud and
discouragement, and no letters came. Once or
twice he attempted to write a respectable letter to
his mother, but he felt so hampered with the thought
of Wainwright having to see it that he kept it
securely in his pocket, and contented himself with
gay-pictured postcards which he had purchased in
Brest, on which he inscribed a few non-committal
sentences, always reminding them of the censor,
and his inability to say what he would, and always
ending, &#8220;Remember me to my friend, and tell her
I have forgotten nothing but cannot write at present
for reasons which I cannot explain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>At night he lay on his watery couch and composed
long letters to Ruth which he dared not put
on paper lest somehow they should come into the
hands of Wainwright. He took great satisfaction
in the fact that he had succeeded in slipping through
a post card addressed to herself from Brest, through
the kindness and understanding of a small boy who
agreed to mail it in exchange for a package of
chewing gum. Here at the camp there was no such
opportunity, but he would wait and watch for another
chance. Meantime the long separation of
miles, and the creeping days, gave him a feeling of
desolation such as he had never experienced before.
He began to grow introspective. He fancied that
perhaps he had overestimated Ruth&#8217;s friendship for
him. The dear memories he had cherished during
the voyage were brought out in the nightwatches
and ruthlessly reviewed, until his own shy hope that
the light in her eyes had been for him began to fade,
and in its place there grew a conviction that happiness
of earth was never for him. For, he reasoned,
if she cared, why did she not write? At least a
post card? Other fellows were getting letters now
and then. Day after day he waited when the mail
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
was distributed, but nothing ever came. His mother
seemed to have forgotten, too. Surely, all these
weeks, some word would have come through. It
was not in reason that his mail should be delayed
beyond others. Could it be that there was false
play somehow? Was Wainwright at the bottom of
this? Or had something happened to his mother,
and had Ruth forgotten?

<h2>XVII</h2>
</div>

<p>The weeks rolled by. The drilling went on.
At last word came that the company was to move up
farther toward the front. They prepared for a long
hike almost eagerly, not knowing yet what was before
them. Anything was better than this intolerable
waiting.
</p>
<p>Solemnly under a leaden sky they gathered;
sullenly went through their inspection; stolidly,
dully, they marched away through the rain and mud
and desolation. The nights were cold and their
clothes seemed thin and inadequate. They had not
been paid since they came over, so there was no
chance to buy any little comfort, even if it had been
for sale. A longing for sweets and home puddings
and pies haunted their waking hours as they trudged
wearily hour after hour, kilometer after kilometer,
coming ever nearer, nearer.
</p>
<p>For two days they hiked, and then entrained for
a long uncomfortable night, and all the time Cameron&#8217;s
soul was crying out within him for the living
God. In these days he read much in the little Testament
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
whenever there was a rest by the wayside, and
he could draw apart from the others. Ever his
soul grew hungrier as he neared the front, and knew
his time now was short. There were days when he
had the feeling that he must stop tramping and do
something about this great matter that hung over
him, and then Wainwright would pass by and cast
a sharp direction at him with a sneer in the curl of
his moustache, and all the fury of his being would
rise up, until he would clench his fists in helpless
wrath, as Wainwright swaggered on. To think
how easily he could drag him in the dust if it only
came to a fair fight between them! But Wainwright
had all the advantage now, with such a captain
on his side!
</p>
<p>That night ride was a terrible experience. Cameron,
with his thoughts surging and pounding
through his brain, was in no condition to come out
of hardships fresh and fit. He was overcome with
weariness when he climbed into the box car with
thirty-nine other fellows just as weary, just as discouraged,
just as homesick.
</p>
<p>There was only room for about twenty to travel
comfortably in that car, but they cheerfully huddled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
together and took their turns sitting down, and
somewhere along in the night it came Cameron&#8217;s
turn to slide down on the floor and stretch out for a
while; or perhaps his utter weariness made him drop
there involuntarily, because he could no longer keep
awake. For a few minutes the delicious ache of
lying flat enveloped him and carried him away into
unconsciousness with a lulling ecstasy. Then suddenly
Wainwright seemed to loom over him and demand
that he rise and let him lie down in his place.
It seemed to Cameron that the lethargy that had
stolen over him as he fell asleep was like heavy bags
of sand tied to his hands and feet. He could not
rise if he would. He thought he tried to tell Wainwright
that he was unfair. He was an officer and
had better accommodations. What need had he to
come back here and steal a weary private&#8217;s sleep.
But his lips refused to open and his throat gave out
no sound. Wainwright seemed gradually stooping
nearer, nearer, with a large soft hand about his
throat, and his little pig eyes gleaming like two
points of green light, his selfish mouth all pursed up
as it used to be when the fellows stole his all-day
sucker, and held it tantalizingly above his reach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
One of his large cushiony knees was upon Cameron&#8217;s
chest now, and the breath was going from him. He
gasped, and tried to shout to the other fellows that
this was the time to do away with this tyrant, this
captain&#8217;s pet, but still only a croak would come
from his lips. With one mighty effort he wrenched
his hands and feet into action, and lunged up at the
mighty bully above him, struggling, clutching
wildly for his throat, with but one thought in his
dreaming brain, to kill&mdash;to kill! Sound came to his
throat at last, action to his sleeping body, and
struggling himself loose from the two comrades who
had fallen asleep upon him and almost succeeded in
smothering him, he gave a hoarse yell and got to
his feet.
</p>
<p>They cursed and laughed at him, and snuggled
down good naturedly to their broken slumbers
again, but Cameron stood in his corner, glaring out
the tiny crack into the dark starless night that was
whirling by, startled into thoughtfulness. The
dream had been so vivid that he could not easily
get rid of it. His heart was boiling hot with rage
at his old enemy, yet something stronger was there,
too, a great horror at himself. He had been about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
to kill a fellow creature! To what pass had he come!
</p>
<p>And somewhere out in that black wet night, a
sweet white face gleamed, with brown hair blown
about it, and the mist of the storm in its locks. It
was as if her spirit had followed him and been present
in that dream to shame him. Supposing the
dream had been true, and he had actually killed
Wainwright! For he knew by the wild beating of
his heart, by the hotness of his wrath as he came
awake, that nothing would have stayed his hand if
he had been placed in such a situation.
</p>
<p>It was <i>like</i> a dream to hover over a poor worn
tempest-tossed soul in that way and make itself
verity; demand that he should live it out again and
again and face the future that would have followed
such a set of circumstances. He had to see Ruth&#8217;s
sad, stern face, the sorrowful eyes full of tears, the
reproach, the disappointment, the alien lifting of
her chin. He knew her so well; could so easily conjecture
what her whole attitude would be, he
thought. And then he must needs go on to think
out once more just what relation there might be
between his enemy and the girl he loved&mdash;think it
out more carefully than he had ever let himself do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
before. All he knew about the two, how their home
grounds adjoined, how their social set and standing
and wealth was the same, how they had often been
seen together; how Wainwright had boasted!
</p>
<p>All night he stood and thought it out, glowering
between the cracks of the car at the passing whirl,
differentiating through the blackness now and then
a group of trees or buildings or a quick flash of
furtive light, but mainly darkness and monotony.
It was as if he were tied to the tail of a comet that
dashed hellwards for a billion years, so long the
night extended till the dull gray dawn. There was
no God anywhere in that dark night. He had forgotten
about Him entirely. He was perhaps
strongly conscious of the devil at his right hand.
</p>
<p>They detrained and hiked across a bit of wet
country that was all alike&mdash;all mud, in the dull light
that grew only to accentuate the ugliness and dreariness
of everything. Sunny France! And this was
sunny France!
</p>
<p>At last they halted along a muddy roadside and
lined up for what seemed an interminable age, waiting
for something, no one knew what, nor cared.
They were beyond caring, most of them, poor boys!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
If their mothers had appeared with a bowl of bread
and milk and called them to bed they would have
wept in her arms with joy. They stood apathetically
and waited, knowing that sometime after another
interminable age had passed, the red tape
necessary to move a large body like themselves
would be unwound, and everything go on again to
another dreary halt somewhere. Would it ever be
over? The long, long trail?
</p>
<p>Cameron stood with the rest in a daze of discouragement,
not taking the trouble to think any
more. His head was hot and his chest felt heavy,
reminding him of Wainwright&#8217;s fat knee; and he
had an ugly cough.
</p>
<p>Suddenly someone&mdash;a comrade&mdash;touched him on
the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in here, Cammie, you&#8217;re all in. This
is the Salvation Army Hut!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron turned. Salvation Army! It sounded
like the bells of heaven. Ah! It was something he
could think back to, that little Salvation Army Hut
at camp! It brought the tears into his throat in a
great lump. He lurched after his friend, and
dropped into the chair where he was pushed, sliding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
his arms out on the table before him and dropping
his head quickly to hide his emotion. He
couldn&#8217;t think what was the matter with him. He
seemed to be all giving way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all in!&#8221; he heard the voice of his friend,
&#8220;I thought maybe you could do something for him.
He&#8217;s a good old sport!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then a gentle hand touched his shoulder, lightly,
like his mother&#8217;s hand. It thrilled him and he lifted
his bleared eyes and looked into the face of a kindly
gray-haired woman.
</p>
<p>She was not a handsome woman, though none of
the boys would ever let her be called homely, for
they claimed her smile was so glorious that it gave
her precedence in beauty to the greatest belle on
earth. There was a real mother lovelight in her
eyes now when she looked at Cameron, and she
held a cup of steaming hot coffee in her hand, real
coffee with sugar and cream and a rich aroma that
gave life to his sinking soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, son, drink this!&#8221; she said, holding the
cup to his lips.
</p>
<p>He opened his lips eagerly and then remembered
and drew back:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, drawing away, &#8220;I forgot, I
haven&#8217;t any money. We&#8217;re all dead broke!&#8221; He
tried to pull himself together and look like a man.
</p>
<p>But the coffee cup came close to his lips again
and the rough motherly hand stole about his shoulders
to support him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right!&#8221; she said in a low, matter-of-fact
tone. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need money here, son, you&#8217;ve
got home, and I&#8217;m your mother to-night. Just
drink this and then come in there behind those
boxes and lie down on my bed and get a wink of
sleep. You&#8217;ll be yourself again in a little while.
That&#8217;s it, son! You&#8217;ve hiked a long way. Now
forget it and take comfort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she soothed him till he surely must be dreaming
again, and wondered which was real, or if perhaps
he had a fever and hallucinations. He reached
a furtive hand and felt of the pine table, and the
chair on which he sat to make sure that he was
awake, and then he looked into her kind gray
eyes and smiled.
</p>
<p>She led him into the little improvised room behind
the counter and tucked him up on her cot with
a big warm blanket.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right now, son,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you stir till you feel like it. I&#8217;ll look after
you and your friend will let you know if there is
any call for you. Just you rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thanked her with his eyes, too weary to speak
a word, and so he dropped into a blessed sleep.
</p>
<p>When he awakened slowly to consciousness
again there was a smell in the air of more coffee,
delicious coffee. He wondered if it was the same
cup, and this only another brief phase of his own
peculiar state. Perhaps he had not been asleep at
all, but had only closed his eyes and opened them
again. But no, it was night, and there were candles
lit beyond the barricade of boxes. He could see
their flicker through the cracks, and shadows were
falling here and there grotesquely on the bit of
canvas that formed another wall. There was some
other odor on the air, too. He sniffed delightedly
like a little child, something sweet and alluring,
reminding one of the days when mother took the
gingerbread and pies out of the oven. No&mdash;doughnuts,
that was it! Doughnuts! Not doughnuts
just behind the trenches! How could that be?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>He stirred and raised up on one elbow to look
about him.
</p>
<p>There were two other cots in the room, arranged
neatly with folded blankets. A box in between held
a few simple toilet articles, a tin basin and a bucket
of water. He eyed them greedily. When had he
had a good wash. What luxury!
</p>
<p>He dropped back on the cot and all at once became
aware that there were strange sounds in the
air above the building in which he lay, strange and
deep, yet regular and with a certain booming monotony
as if they had been going on a long time,
and he had been too preoccupied to take notice of
them. A queer frenzy seized his heart. This, then,
was the sound of battle in the distance! He was
here at the front at last! And that was the sound
of enemy shells! How strange it seemed! How it
gripped the soul with the audacity of it all! How
terrible, and yet how exciting to be here at last! And
yet he had an unready feeling. Something was still
undone to prepare him for this ordeal. It was his
subconscious self that was crying out for God. His
material self had sensed the doughnuts that were
frying so near to him, and he looked up eagerly to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
welcome whoever was coming tiptoing in to see if
he was awake, with a nice hot plate of them for
him to eat!
</p>
<p>He swung to a sitting posture, and received
them and the cup of hot chocolate that accompanied
them with eagerness, like a little child whose mother
had promised them if he would be good. Strange
how easy and natural it was to fall into the ways of
this gracious household. Would one call it that?
It seemed so like a home!
</p>
<p>While he was eating, his buddy slipped in
smiling excitedly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great news, Cammie! We&#8217;ve got a new captain!
And, oh boy! He&#8217;s a peach! He sat on our
louie first off! You oughtta have seen poor old
Wainwright&#8217;s face when he shut him up at the headquarters.
Boy, you&#8217;d a croaked! It was rich!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron finished the last precious bite of his
third hot doughnut with a gulp of joy:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of Wurtz?&#8221; he asked
anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Canned, I guess,&#8221; hazarded the private. &#8220;I
did hear they took him to a sanitarium, nervous
breakdown, they said. I&#8217;ll tell the world he&#8217;d have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
had one for fair if he&#8217;d stayed with this outfit much
longer. I only wish they&#8217;d have taken his little pet
along with him. This is no place for little Harold
and he&#8217;ll find it out now he&#8217;s got a real captain.
Good-night! How d&#8217;you &#8217;spose he ever got his commission,
anyway? Well, how are you, old top?
Feelin&#8217; better? I knew they&#8217;d fix you up here.
They&#8217;re reg&#8217;ler guys! Well, I guess we better hit
the hay. Come on, I&#8217;ll show you where your billet
is. I looked out for a place with a good water-tight
roof. What d&#8217;ye think of the orchestra Jerry is
playing out there on the front? Some noise, eh,
what? Say, this little old hut is some good place to
tie up to, eh, pard! I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em before, that&#8217;s
how I knew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the days that followed Cameron spent
most of his leisure time in the Salvation Army Hut.
</p>
<p>He did not hover around the victrola as he
would probably have done several months before,
nor yet often join his voice in the ragtime song
that was almost continuous at the piano, regardless
of nearby shells, and usually accompanied by another
tune on the victrola. He did not hover around
the cooks and seek to make himself needful to them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
there, placing himself at the seat of supplies and
handy when he was hungry&mdash;as did many. He sat
at one of the far tables, often writing letters or
reading his little book, or more often looking off
into space, seeing those last days at camp, and the
faces of his mother and Ruth.
</p>
<p>There was more than one reason why he spent
much of his time here. The hut was not frequented
much by officers, although they did come sometimes,
and were always welcomed, but never deferred to.
Wainwright would not be likely to be about and it
was always a relief to feel free from the presence of
his enemy. But gradually a third reason came to
play a prominent part in bringing him here, and
that was the atmosphere. He somehow felt as if
he were among real people who were living life earnestly,
as if the present were not all there was.
</p>
<p>There came a day when they were to move on
up to the actual front. Cameron wrote letters, such
as he had not dared to write before, for he had found
out that these women could get them to his people
in case anything should happen to him, and so he
left a little letter for Ruth and one for his mother,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
and asked the woman with the gray eyes to get them
back home somehow.
</p>
<p>There was not much of moment in the letters.
Even thus he dared not speak his heart for the iron
of Wainwright&#8217;s poison had entered into his soul.
He had begun to think that perhaps, in spite of all
her friendliness, Ruth really belonged to another
world, not his world. Yet just her friendliness
meant much to him in his great straight of loneliness.
He would take that much of her, at least, even if it
could never be more. He would leave a last word
for her. If behind his written words there was
breaking heart and tender love, she would never
dream it. If his soul was really taking another farewell
of her, what harm, since he said no sad word.
Yet it did him good to write these letters and feel a
reasonable assurance that they would sometime
reach their destination.
</p>
<p>There was a meeting held that night in the hut.
He had never happened to attend one before, although
he had heard the boys say they enjoyed
them. One of his comrades asked him to stay, and
a quick glance told him the fellow needed him, had
chosen him for moral support.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>So Cameron sat in a shadowy corner of the
crowded room, and listened to the singing, wild and
strong, and with no hint of coming battle in its full
rolling lilt. He noted with satisfaction how the
&#8220;Long, Long Trail,&#8221; and &#8220;Pack Up Your
Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag&#8221; gradually gave
place to &#8220;Tell Mother I&#8217;ll Be There,&#8221; and &#8220;When
the Roll is Called Up Yonder,&#8221; growing strong and
full and solemn in the grand old melody of &#8220;Abide
With Me.&#8221; There were fellows there who but a few
hours before had been shooting crap, whose lips had
been loud with cheerful curses. Now they sat and
sang with all their hearts, the heartiest of the lot.
It was a curious psychological study to watch them.
Some of them were just as keen now on the religious
side of their natures as they had been with their
sport or their curses. Theirs were primitive natures,
easily wrought upon by the atmosphere of the moment,
easily impressed by the solemnity of the hour,
nearer, perhaps, to stopping to think about God
and eternity than ever before in their lives. But
there were also others here, thoughtful fellows who
were strong and brave, who had done their duty and
borne their hardships with the best, yet whose faces
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
now were solemn with earnestness, to whom this
meeting meant a last sacrament before they passed
to meet their test. Cameron felt his heart in perfect
sympathy with the gathering, and when the singing
stopped for a few minutes and the clear voice of a
young girl began to pray, he bowed his head with a
smart of tears in his eyes. She was a girl who had
just arrived that day, and she reminded him of
Ruth. She had pansy-blue eyes and long gold
ripples in her abundant hair. It soothed him like a
gentle hand on his heart to hear her speak those
words of prayer to God, praying for them all as if
they were her own brothers, praying as if she understood
just how they felt this night before they went
on their way. She was so young and gently cared
for, this girl with her plain soldier&#8217;s uniform, and
her fearlessness, praying as composedly out there
under fire as if she trusted perfectly that her heavenly
Father had control of everything and would
do the best for them all. What a wonderful girl!
Or, no&mdash;was it perhaps a wonderful trust? Stay,
was it not perhaps a wonderful heavenly Father?
And she had found Him? Perhaps she could tell
him the way and how he had missed it in his search!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>With this thought in his mind he lingered as the
most of the rest passed out, and turning he noticed
that the man who had come with him lingered also,
and edged up to the front where the lassie stood
talking with a group of men.
</p>
<p>Then one of the group spoke up boldly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Cap,&#8221; he addressed her almost reverently,
as if he had called her some queenly name instead of
captain, &#8220;say, Cap, I want to ask you a question.
Some of those fellows that preached to us have been
telling us that if we go over there, and don&#8217;t come
back it&#8217;ll be all right with us, just because we died
fighting for liberty. But we don&#8217;t believe that dope.
Why&mdash;d&#8217;ye mean to tell me, Cap, that if a fellow
has been rotten all his life he gets saved just because
he happened to get shot in a battle? Why some of
us didn&#8217;t even come over here to fight because we
wanted to; we had to, we were drafted. Do you
mean to tell me that makes it all right over here? I
can&#8217;t see that at all. And we want to know the
truth. You dope it out for us, Cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young captain lassie slowly shook her head:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just dying doesn&#8217;t save you, son.&#8221; There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
was a note of tenderness in that &#8220;son&#8221; as those
Salvation Army lassies spoke it, that put them
infinitely above the common young girl, as if some
angelic touch had set them apart for their holy ministry.
It was as if God were using their lips and
eyes and spirits to speak to these, his children, in
their trying hour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s this way. Everybody has sinned,
and the penalty of sin is death. You all know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her eyes searched their faces, and appealed to
the truth hidden in the depths of their souls. They
nodded, those boys who were going out soon to face
death. They were willing to tell her that they
acknowledged their sins. They did not mind if they
said it before each other. They meant it now. Yes,
they were sinners and it was because they knew they
were that they wanted to know what chances they
stood in the other world.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But God loved us all so much that He wanted
to make a way for us to escape the punishment,&#8221;
went on the sweet steady voice, seeming to bring
the very love of the Father down into their midst
with its forceful, convincing tone. &#8220;And so He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
sent His son, Jesus Christ, to take our place and
die on the Cross in our stead. Whoever is willing
to accept His atonement may be saved. And it&#8217;s
all up to us whether we will take it or not. It isn&#8217;t
anything we can do or be. It is just taking Jesus
as our Saviour, believing in Him, and taking Him
at His word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron lingered and knelt with the rest when
she prayed again for them, and in his own heart he
echoed the prayer of acceptance that others were
putting up. As he went out into the black night,
and later, on the silent march through the dark, he
was turning it over in his mind. It seemed to him
the simplest, the most sensible explanation of the
plan of Salvation he had ever heard. He wondered
if the minister at home knew all this and had meant
it when he tried to explain. But no, that minister
had not tried to explain, he had told him he would
grow into it, and here he was perhaps almost at the
end and he had not grown into it yet. That young
girl to-night had said it took only an instant to
settle the whole thing, and she looked as if her soul
was resting on it. Why could he not get peace?
Why could he not find God?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>Then out of the dark and into his thoughts came
a curse and a sneer and a curt rebuke from Wainwright,
and all his holy and beautiful thoughts fled!
He longed to lunge out of the dark and spring upon
that fat, flabby lieutenant, and throttle him. So, in
bitterness of spirit he marched out to face the foe.

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p>When Ruth Macdonald got back from camp
she found herself utterly dissatisfied with her old
life. The girls in her social set were full of war
plans. They had one and all enlisted in every
activity that was going. Each one appeared in some
pretty and appropriate uniform, and took the new
régime with as much eagerness and enthusiasm as
ever she had put into dancing and dressing.
</p>
<p>Not that they had given up either of those employments.
Oh, dear no! When they were not
busy getting up little dances for the poor dear soldier
boys from the nearby camps, they were learning
new solo steps wherewith to entertain those
soldier boys when their turn came to go to camp and
keep up the continuous performance that seemed to
be necessary to the cheering of a good soldier. And
as for dressing, no one need ever suggest again a
uniform for women as the solution of the high cost
of dressing. The number of dainty devices of gold
braid and red stars and silver tassels that those same
staid uniforms developed made plain forever that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the woman who chooses can make even a uniform
distinctive and striking and altogether costly. In
short they went into the war with the same superficial
flightiness formerly employed in the social
realms. They went dashing here and there in their
high-power cars on solemn errands, with all the
nonchalance of their ignorance and youth, till one,
knowing some of them well, trembled for the errand
if it were important. And many of them were
really useful, which only goes to prove that a tremendous
amount of unsuspected power is wasted
every year and that unskilled labor often accomplishes
almost as much as skilled. Some of them
secured positions in the Navy Yard, or in other
public offices, where they were thrown delightfully
into intimacies with officers, and were able to step
over the conventionalities of their own social positions
into wildly exciting Bohemian adventures
under the popular guise of patriotism, without a
rebuke from their elders. There was not a dull
hour in the little town. The young men of their
social set might all be gone to war, but there were
others, and the whirl of life went on gaily for the
thoughtless butterflies, who danced and knitted and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
drove motor cars, and made bandages and just rejoiced
to walk the streets knitting on the Sabbath
day, a gay cretonne knitting bag on arm, and knitting
needles plying industriously as if the world
would go naked if they did not work every minute.
Just a horde of rebellious young creatures, who at
heart enjoyed the unwonted privilege of breaking
the Sabbath and shocking a few fanatics, far more
than they really cared to knit. But nobody had
time to pry into the quality of such patriotism.
There were too many other people doing the same
thing, and so it passed everywhere for the real thing,
and the world whirled on and tried to be gay to
cover its deep heartache and stricken horror over
the sacrifice of its sons.
</p>
<p>But Ruth, although she bravely tried for several
weeks, could not throw herself into such things.
She felt that they were only superficial. There
might be a moiety of good in all these things, but
they were not the real big things of life; not the
ways in which the vital help could be given, and she
longed with her whole soul to get in on it somewhere.
</p>
<p>The first Sabbath after her return from camp
she happened into a bit of work which while it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
in no way connected with war work, still helped to
interest her deeply and keep her thinking along the
lines that had been started while she was with
John Cameron.
</p>
<p>A quiet, shy, plain little woman, an old member
of the church and noted for good work, came hurrying
down the aisle after the morning service and implored
a young girl in the pew just in front of Ruth
to help her that afternoon in an Italian Sunday
school she was conducting in a small settlement
about a mile and a half from Bryne Haven:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only to play the hymns, Miss Emily,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Carrie Wayne has to go to a funeral. She
always plays for me. I wouldn&#8217;t ask you if I could
play the least mite myself, but I can&#8217;t. And the
singing won&#8217;t go at all without someone to play
the piano.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Mrs. Beck, but I really can&#8217;t!&#8221;
pleaded Miss Emily quickly. &#8220;I promised to help
out in the canteen work this afternoon. You know
the troop trains are coming through, and Mrs. Martin
wanted me to take her place all the afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Beck&#8217;s face expressed dismay. She gave a
hasty glance around the rapidly emptying church.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let them do without singing for once,&#8221; suggested
the carefree Emily. &#8220;Everybody ought to
learn to do without something in war time. We
conserve sugar and flour, let the Italians conserve
singing!&#8221; and with a laugh at her own brightness
she hurried away.
</p>
<p>Ruth reached forward and touched the troubled
little missionary on the arm:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I do?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I never played
hymns much, but I could try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Would you?&#8221; A flood of relief went
over the woman&#8217;s face, and Ruth was instantly glad
she had offered. She took Mrs. Beck down to the
settlement in her little runabout, and the afternoon&#8217;s
experience opened a new world to her. It was the
first time she had ever come in contact with the
really poor and lowly of the earth, and she proved
herself a true child of God in that she did not shrink
from them because many of them were dirty and
poorly clad. Before the first afternoon was over
she had one baby in her arms and three others hanging
about her chair with adoring glances. They
could not talk in her language, but they stared into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
her beautiful face with their great dark eyes, and
spoke queer unintelligible words to one another
about her. The whole little company were delighted
with the new &#8220;pretty lady&#8221; who had come among
them. They openly examined her simple lovely
frock and hat and touched with shy furtive fingers
the blue ribbon that floated over the bench from her
girdle. Mrs. Beck was in the seventh heaven and
begged her to come again, and Ruth, equally
charmed, promised to go every Sunday. For it
appeared that the wayward pianist was very irregular
and had to be constantly coaxed.
</p>
<p>Ruth entered into the work with zest. She took
the children&#8217;s class which formerly had been with
the older ones, and gathering them about her told
them Bible stories till their young eyes bulged with
wonder and their little hearts almost burst with love
of her. Love God? Of course they would. Try
to please Jesus? Certainly, if &#8220;Mrs. Ruth,&#8221; as
they called her, said they should. They adored her.
</p>
<p>She fell into the habit of going down during the
week and slipping into their homes with a big basket
of bright flowers from her home garden which she
distributed to young and old. Even the men, when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
they happened to be home from work, wanted the
flowers, and touched them with eager reverence.
Somehow the little community of people so different
from herself filled her thoughts more and more.
She began to be troubled that some of the men
drank and beat their wives and little children in
consequence. She set herself to devise ways to keep
them from it. She scraped acquaintance with one
or two of the older boys in her own church and
enlisted them to help her, and bought a moving picture
machine which she took to the settlement. She
spent hours attending moving picture shows that
she might find the right films for their use. Fortunately
she had money enough for all her schemes,
and no one to hinder her good work, although Aunt
Rhoda did object strenuously at first on the ground
that she might &#8220;catch something.&#8221; But Ruth only
smiled and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m out for,
Auntie, dear! I want to catch them all, and try to
make them live better lives. Other people are going
to France. I haven&#8217;t got a chance to go yet, but
while I stay here I must do something. I can&#8217;t be
an idler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aunt Rhoda looked at her quizzically. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
wondered if Ruth was worried about one of her men
friends&mdash;and which one?
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only take up some nice work for the
Government, dear, such as the other girls are
doing!&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;work that would bring you
into contact with nice people! You always have to
do something queer. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know where
you got your low tendencies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth would be off before more could be
said. This was an old topic of Aunt Rhoda&#8217;s and
had been most fully discussed during the young
years of Ruth&#8217;s life, so that she did not care to enter
into it further.
</p>
<p>But Ruth was not fully satisfied with just helping
her Italians. The very week she came back from
camp she had gone to their old family physician who
held a high and responsible position in the medical
world, and made her plea:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy-Doctor,&#8221; she said, using her old childish
name for him, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to find a way for me
to go over there and help the war. I know I don&#8217;t
know much about nursing, but I&#8217;m sure I could
learn. I&#8217;ve taken care of Grandpa and Auntie a
great many times and watched the trained nurses,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
and I&#8217;m sure if Lalla Farrington and Bernice
Brooks could get into the Red Cross and go over in
such a short time I&#8217;m as bright as they.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brighter!&#8221; said the old doctor eyeing her approvingly.
&#8220;But what will your people say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to let me, Daddy-Doctor. Besides,
everybody else is doing it, and you know that
has great weight with Aunt Rhoda.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard life, child! You never saw much
of pain and suffering and horror.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s time, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But those men over there you would have to
care for will not be like your grandfather and aunt.
They will be dirty and bloody, and covered with
filth and vermin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you stand it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think I&#8217;m a butterfly, too, do you,
Daddy-Doctor? Well, I want to prove to you that
I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ve been doing my best to get used to
dirt and distress. I washed a little sick Italian baby
yesterday and helped it&#8217;s mother scrub her floor and
make the house clean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dickens you did!&#8221; beamed the doctor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
proudly. &#8220;I always knew you had a lot of grit. I
guess you&#8217;ve got the right stuff in you. But say,
if I help you you&#8217;ve got to tell me the real reason
why you want to go, or else&mdash;nothing doing! Understand?
I know you aren&#8217;t like the rest, just wanting
to get into the excitement and meet a lot of
officers and have a good time so you can say afterward
you were there. You aren&#8217;t that kind of a
girl. What&#8217;s the real reason you want to go? Have
you got somebody over there you&#8217;re interested in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her keenly, with loving, anxious
eyes as her father&#8217;s friend who had known her from
birth might look.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s face grew rosy, and her eyes dropped,
but lifted again undaunted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I have, Daddy-Doctor, is there anything
wrong about that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor frowned:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that fat chump of a Wainwright, is it?
Because if it is I shan&#8217;t lift my finger to help you go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth&#8217;s laugh rang out clear and free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! dear friend, never! Set your mind at
rest about him,&#8221; she finished, sobering down. &#8220;And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
if I care for someone, Daddy-Doctor, can&#8217;t you
trust me I&#8217;d pick out someone who was all right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so!&#8221; grumbled the doctor only half
satisfied, &#8220;but girls are so dreadfully blind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d like him,&#8221; she hazarded, her
cheeks growing pinker, &#8220;that is, you would if there
<i>is</i> anybody,&#8221; she corrected herself laughing. &#8220;But
you see, it&#8217;s a secret yet and maybe always will be.
I&#8217;m not sure that he knows, and I&#8217;m not quite sure
I know myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; said the doctor watching her sweet
face with a tender jealousy in his eyes. &#8220;Well, I
suppose I&#8217;ll help you to go, but I&#8217;ll shoot him, remember,
if he doesn&#8217;t turn out to be all right. It
would take a mighty superior person to be good
enough for you, little girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what he is,&#8221; said Ruth sweetly,
and then rising and stooping over him she dropped
a kiss on the wavy silver lock of hair that hung over
the doctor&#8217;s forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Daddy-Doctor! I knew you
would,&#8221; she said happily. &#8220;And please don&#8217;t be too
long about it. I&#8217;m in a great hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor promised, of course. No one could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
resist Ruth when she was like that, and in due time
certain forces were set in operation to the end that
she might have her desire.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as she waited, Ruth filled her days
with thoughts of others, not forgetting Cameron&#8217;s
mother for whom she was always preparing some
little surprise, a dainty gift, some fruit or flowers,
a book that she thought might comfort and while
away her loneliness, a restful ride at the early evening,
all the little things that a thoughtful daughter
might do for a mother. And Cameron&#8217;s mother
wrote him long letters about it all which would have
delighted his heart during those dreary days if they
could only have reached him then.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s letters to Cameron were full of the
things she was doing, full of her sweet wise thoughts
that seemed to be growing wiser every day. She
had taken pictures of her Italian friends and introduced
him to them one by one. She had filled every
page with little word pictures of her daily life. It
seemed a pity that he could not have had them just
when he needed them most. It would have filled
her with dismay if she could have known the long
wandering journey that was before those letters before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
they would finally reach him; she might have
been discouraged from writing them.
</p>
<p>Little Mrs. Beck was suddenly sent for one
Sunday morning to attend her sister who was very
ill, and she hastily called Ruth over the telephone
and begged her to take her place at the Sunday
school. Ruth promised to secure some one to teach
the lesson, but found to her dismay that no one was
willing to go at such short notice. And so, with
trembling heart she knelt for a hasty petition that
God would guide her and show her how to lead these
simple people in the worship of the day.
</p>
<p>As she stood before them trying to make plain
in the broken, mixed Italian and English, the story
of the blind man, which was the lesson for the day,
there came over her a sense of her great responsibility.
She knew that these people trusted her and
that what she told them they would believe, and her
heart lifted itself in a sharp cry for help, for light,
to give to them. She felt an appalling lack of
knowledge and experience herself. Where had she
been all these young years of her life, and what had
she been doing that she had not learned the way of
life so that she might put it before them?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>Before her sat a woman bowed with years, her
face seamed with sorrow and hard work, and grimed
with lack of care, a woman whose husband frequently
beat her for attending Sunday school.
There were four men on the back seat, hard workers,
listening with eager eyes, assenting vigorously when
she spoke of the sorrow on the earth. They, too,
had seen trouble. They sat there patient, sad-eyed,
wistful; what could she show them out of the Book
of God to bring a light of joy to their faces? There
were little children whose future looked so full of
hard knocks and toil that it seemed a wonder they
were willing to grow up knowing what was before
them. The money that had smoothed her way thus
far through life was not for them. The comfortable
home and food and raiment and light and luxury
that had made her life so full of ease were almost
unknown to them. Had she anything better to
offer them than mere earthly comforts which probably
could never be theirs, no matter how hard they
might strive? But, after all, money and ease could
in no way soothe the pain of the heart, and she had
come close enough already to these people to know
they had each one his own heart&#8217;s pain and sorrow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
to bear. There was one man who had lost five little
children by death. That death had come in consequence
of dirt and ignorance made it no easier to
bear. The dirt and ignorance had not all been his
fault. People who were wiser and had not cared
to help were to blame. What was the remedy for
the world&#8217;s sorrow, the world&#8217;s need?
</p>
<p>Ruth knew in a general way that Jesus Christ
was the Saviour of the world, that His name should
be the remedy for evil; but how to put it to them in
simple form, ah! that was it. It was Cameron&#8217;s
search for God, and it seemed that all the world was
on the same search. But now to-day she had suddenly
come on some of the footprints of the Man of
Sorrow as He toiled over the mountains of earth
searching for lost humanity, and her own heart
echoed His love and sorrow for the world. She cried
out in her helplessness for something to give to these
wistful people.
</p>
<p>Somehow the prayer must have been answered,
for the little congregation hung upon her words,
and one old man with deep creases in his forehead
and kindly wrinkles around his eyes spoke out in
meeting and said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I like God. I like Him good. I like Him all
e time wi&#8217; mee! All e time. Ev&#8217;e where! Him live
in my house!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tears sprang to her eyes with answering
sympathy. Here in her little mission she had found
a brother soul, seeking after God. She had another
swift vision then of what the kinship of the whole
world meant, and how Christ could love everybody.
</p>
<p>After Sunday school was out little Sanda came
stealing up to her:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine brudder die,&#8221; she said sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Tony? The pretty fat baby? Oh,
I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; said Ruth putting her arm tenderly
around the little girl. &#8220;Where is your mother? I
must go and see her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Down the winding unkept road they walked, the
delicately reared girl and the little Italian drudge,
to the hovel where the family were housed, a
tumbled-down affair of ancient stone, tawdrily
washed over in some season past with scaling pink
whitewash. The noisy abode of the family pig was
in front of the house in the midst of a trim little
garden of cabbage, lettuce, garlic, and tomatoes.
But the dirty swarming little house usually so full
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
of noise and good cheer was tidy to-day, and no
guests hovered on the brief front stoop sipping
from a friendly bottle, or playing the accordion.
There was not an accordion heard in the community,
for there had been a funeral that morning and every
one was trying to be quiet out of respect for the
bereaved parents.
</p>
<p>And there in the open doorway, in his shirt
sleeves, crouched low upon the step, sat the head of
the house, his swarthy face bowed upon his knees, a
picture of utter despair, and just beyond the
mother&#8217;s head was bowed upon her folded arms on
the window seat, and thus they mourned in public
silence before their little world.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s heart went out to the two poor ignorant
creatures in their grief as she remembered the little
dark child with the brown curls and glorious eyes
who had resembled one of Raphael&#8217;s cherubs, and
thought how empty the mother&#8217;s arms would be
without him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sanda, tell your mother how sorry I am!&#8221;
she said to the little girl, for the mother could not
speak or understand English. &#8220;Tell her not to
mourn so terribly, dear. Tell her that the dear baby
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
is safe and happy with Jesus! Tell her she will go
to Him some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And as the little girl interpreted her words, suddenly
Ruth knew that what she was speaking was
truth, truth she might have heard before but never
recognized or realized till now.
</p>
<p>The mother lifted her sorrowful face all tear
swollen and tried a pitiful smile, nodded to say she
understood, then dropped sobbing again upon the
window sill. The father lifted a sad face, not too
sober, but blear-eyed and pitiful, too, in his hopelessness,
and nodded as if he accepted the fact she had
told but it gave him no comfort, and then went back
to his own despair.
</p>
<p>Ruth turned away with aching heart, praying:
&#8220;Oh, God, they need you! Come and comfort them.
I don&#8217;t know how!&#8221; But somehow, on her homeward
way she seemed to have met and been greeted
by her Saviour.
</p>
<p>It was so she received her baptism for the work
that she was to do.
</p>
<p>The next day permission came for her to go to
France, and she entered upon her brief training.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dread to have her go?&#8221; asked a
neighbor of Aunt Rhoda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; sighed the good lady comfortably,
&#8220;but then she is going in good company, and it isn&#8217;t
as if all the best people weren&#8217;t doing it. Of course,
it will be great experience for her, and I wouldn&#8217;t
want to keep her out of it. She&#8217;ll meet a great many
nice people over there that she might not have met
if she had stayed at home. Everybody, they tell
me, is at work over there. She&#8217;ll be likely to meet
the nobility. It isn&#8217;t as if we didn&#8217;t have friends
there, too, who will be sure to invite her over week
ends. If she gets tired she can go to them, you
know. And really, I was glad to have something
come up to take her away from that miserable little
country slum she has been so crazy about. I was
dreadfully afraid she would catch something there
or else they would rob us and murder us and kidnap
her some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that was the way things presented themselves
to Aunt Rhoda!

<h2>XIX</h2>
</div>

<p>All day the shells had been flying thick and
fast. When night settled down the fire was so continuous
that one could trace the battle front by the
reflection in the sky.
</p>
<p>Cameron stood at his post under the stars and
cried out in his soul for God. For days now Death
had stalked them very close. His comrades had
fallen all about him. There seemed to be no chance
for safety. And where was God? Had He no part
in all this Hell on earth? Did He not care? Would
He not be found? All his seeking and praying and
reading of the little book seemed to have brought
God no nearer. He was going out pretty soon, in
the natural order of the battle if things kept on, out
into the other life, without having found the God
who had promised that if he would believe, and if
he would seek with all his heart he would surely
find Him.
</p>
<p>Once in a Y.M.C.A. hut on a Sunday night a
great tenor came to entertain them, and sang almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
the very words that the stranger back in the States
had written in his little book:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;If with, all your hearts ye truly seek Him ye shall ever
surely find him. Thus saith your God!&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>And ever since that song had rung its wonderful
melody down deep in his heart he had been seeking,
seeking in all the ways he knew, with a longing
that would not be satisfied. And yet he seemed to
have found nothing.
</p>
<p>So now as he walked silently beneath the stars,
looking up, his soul was crying out with the longing
of despair to find a Saviour, the Christ of his soul.
Amid all the shudderings of the battle-rent earth,
the concussions of the bursting shells, could even
God hear a soul&#8217;s low cry?
</p>
<p>Suddenly out in the darkness in front of him
there flickered a tiny light, only a speck of a glint
it was, the spark of a cigarette, but it was where it
had no business to be, and it was Cameron&#8217;s business
to see that it was not there. They had been
given strict orders that there must be no lights and
no sounds to give away their position. Even though
his thoughts were with the stars in his search for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
God, his senses were keen and on the alert. He
sprang instantly and silently, appearing before the
delinquent like a miracle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; he said under his breath. &#8220;Can that
cigarette!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t know who I am!&#8221; swaggered
a voice thick and unnatural that yet had a
familiar sound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes no difference who you are, you can&#8217;t
smoke on this post while I&#8217;m on duty. Those are
my orders!&#8221; and with a quick motion he caught the
cigarette from the loose lips and extinguished it,
grinding it into the ground with his heel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;have you&mdash;c-c-co-marshalled fer this!&#8221;
stuttered the angry officer, stepping back unsteadily
and raising his fist.
</p>
<p>In disgust Cameron turned his back and walked
away. How had Wainwright managed to bring
liquor with him to the front? Something powerful
and condensed, no doubt, to steady his nerves in
battle. Wainwright had ever been noted for his
cowardice. His breath was heavy with it. How
could a man want to meet death in such a way? He
turned to look again, and Wainwright was walking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
unsteadily away across the line where they had been
forbidden to go, out into the open where the shells
were flying. Cameron watched him for an instant
with mingled feelings. To think he called himself
a man, and dared to boast of marrying such a woman
as Ruth Macdonald. Well, what if he did go into
danger and get killed! The world was better off
without him! Cameron&#8217;s heart was burning hot
within him. His enemy was at last within his power.
No one but himself had seen Wainwright move off
in that direction where was certain death within a
few minutes. It was no part of his duty to stop him.
He was not supposed to know he had been drinking.
</p>
<p>The whistle of a shell went ricocheting through
the air and Cameron dropped as he had been taught
to do, but lifted his eyes in time to see Wainwright
throw up his arms, drop on the edge of the hill, and
disappear. The shell plowed its way in a furrow a
few feet away and Cameron rose to his feet.
Sharply, distinctly, in a brief lull of the din about
him he heard his name called. It sounded from
down the hill, a cry of distress, but it did not sound
like Wainwright&#8217;s voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cameron! Come! Help!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>He obeyed instantly, although, strange to say,
he had no thought of its being Wainwright. He
crept cautiously out to the edge of the hill and
looked over. The blare of the heavens made objects
below quite visible. He could see Wainwright
huddled as he had fallen. While he looked the
injured man lifted his head, struggled to crawl
feebly, but fell back again. He felt a sense of
relief that at last his enemy was where he could do
no more harm. Then, through the dim darkness he
saw a figure coming toward the prostrate form, and
stooping over to touch him. It showed white against
the darkness and it paid no heed to the shell that
suddenly whistled overhead. It half lifted the head
of the fallen officer, and then straightened up and
looked toward Cameron; and again, although there
was no sound audible now in the din that the battle
was making, he felt himself called.
</p>
<p>A strange thrill of awe possessed him. Was
that the Christ out there whom he had been seeking?
And what did he expect of him? To come out
there to his enemy? To the man who had been in
many ways the curse of his young life?
</p>
<p>Suddenly as he still hesitated a verse from his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Testament which had often come to his notice returned
clearly to his mind:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If thou bringest thy gift to the altar, and there
rememberest that thy brother hath aught against
thee, leave there thy gift before the altar. First be
reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer
thy gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Was this, then, what was required of him? Had
his hate toward Wainwright been what had hindered
him from finding God?
</p>
<p>There was no time now to argue that this man
was not his brother. The man would be killed certainly
if he lay there many minutes. The opportunity
would pass as quickly as it had come. The
Christ he sought was out there expecting him to
come, and he must lose no time in going to Him.
How gladly would he have faced death to go to
Him! But Wainwright! That was different!
Could it be this that was required of him? Then
back in his soul there echoed the words: &#8220;If with
all your heart ye truly seek.&#8221; Slowly he crept forward
over the brow of the hill, and into the light,
going toward that white figure above the huddled
dark one; creeping painfully, with bullets ripping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
up the earth about him. He was going to the Christ,
with all his heart&mdash;yes, all his heart! Even if it
meant putting by his enmity forever!
</p>
<p>Somewhere on the way he understood.
</p>
<p>When he reached the fallen man there was no
white figure there, but he was not surprised nor disappointed.
The Christ was not there because he
had entered into his heart. He had found Him
at last!
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Back at the base hospital they told Wainwright
one day how Cameron had crawled with him on his
back, out from under the searchlights amid the
shells, and into safety. It was the only thing that
saved his life, for if he had lain long with the wound
he had got, there would have been no chance for
him. Wainwright, when he heard it, lay thoughtful
for a long time, a puzzled, half-sullen look on
his face. He saw that everybody considered Cameron
a hero. There was no getting away from that
the rest of his life. One could not in decency be an
enemy of a man who had saved one&#8217;s life. Cameron
had won out in a final round. It would not be good
policy not to recognize it. It would be entirely too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
unpopular. He must make friends with him. It
would be better to patronize him than to be patronized
by him. Perhaps also, down in the depths of
his fat selfish heart there was a little bit of gratitude
mixed with it all. For he <i>did</i> love life, and he <i>was</i>
a mortal coward.
</p>
<p>So he sent for Cameron one day, and Cameron
came. He did not want to come. He dreaded the
interview worse than anything he had ever had to
face before. But he came. He came with the
same spirit he had gone out into the shell-fire after
Wainwright. Because he felt that the Christ asked
it of him.
</p>
<p>He stood stern and grave at the foot of the little
hospital cot and listened while Wainwright pompously
thanked him, and told him graciously that
now that he had saved his life he was going to put
aside all the old quarrels and be his friend. Cameron
smiled sadly. There was no bitterness in his smile.
Perhaps just the least fringe of amusement, but no
hardness. He even took the bandaged hand that
was offered as a token that peace had come between
them who had so long been at war. All the
time were ringing in his heart the words: &#8220;With
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
all your heart! With all your heart!&#8221; He had the
Christ, what else mattered?
</p>
<p>Somehow Wainwright felt that he had not quite
made the impression on this strong man that he had
hoped, and in an impulse to be more than gracious
he reached his good hand under his pillow and
brought forth an envelope.
</p>
<p>When Corporal Cameron saw the writing on
that envelop he went white under the tan of
the battlefield, but he stood still and showed no
other sign:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get back home I&#8217;m going to be married,&#8221;
said the complacent voice, &#8220;and my wife and
I will want you to come and take dinner with us
some day. I guess you know who the girl is. She
lives in Bryne Haven up on the hill. Her name is
Ruth Macdonald. I&#8217;ve just had a letter from her.
I&#8217;ll have to write her how you saved my life. She&#8217;ll
want to thank you, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>How could Cameron possibly know that that
envelope addressed in Ruth Macdonald&#8217;s precious
handwriting contained nothing but the briefest
word of thanks for an elaborate souvenir that Wainwright
had sent her from France?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Cammie?&#8221; his comrades
asked one another when he came back to his
company. &#8220;He looks as though he had lost his last
friend. Did he care so much for that Wainwright
guy that he saved? I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t see what he
sees in him. I wouldn&#8217;t have taken the trouble to
go out after him, would you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s influence had been felt quietly among
his company. In his presence the men refrained
from certain styles of conversation, when he sat
apart and read his Testament they hushed their
boisterous talk, and lately some had come to read
with him. He was generally conceded to be the
bravest man in their company, and when a fellow
had to die suddenly he liked Cameron to hold him
in his arms.
</p>
<p>So far Cameron had not had a scratch, and the
men had come to think he had a charmed life. More
than he knew he was beloved of them all. More
than they knew their respect for him was deepening
into a kind of awe. They felt he had a power with
him that they understood not. He was still the silent
corporal. He talked not at all of his new-found
experience, yet it shone in his face in a mysterious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
light. Even after he came from Wainwright with
that stricken look, there was above it all a glory behind
his eyes that not even that could change. For
three days he went into the thick of the battle, moving
from one hairbreadth escape to another with
the calmness of an angel who knows his life is not
of earth, and on the fourth day there came the awful
battle, the struggle for a position that had been held
by the enemy for four years, and that had been
declared impregnable from the side of the Allies.
</p>
<p>The boys all fought bravely and many fell, but
foremost of them all passing unscathed from height
to height, Corporal Cameron on the lead in fearlessness
and spirit; and when the tide at last was turned
and they stood triumphant among the dead, and
saw the enemy retiring in disorder, it was Cameron
who was still in the forefront, his white face and
tattered uniform catching the last rays of the setting
sun.
</p>
<p>Later when the survivors had all come together
one came to the captain with a white face and
anxious eyes:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, where&#8217;s Cammie? We can&#8217;t find
him anywhere.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He came a half hour ago and volunteered to
slip through the enemy&#8217;s lines to-night and send us
back a message,&#8221; he said in husky tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, captain, he was wounded!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was?&#8221; The captain looked up startled.
&#8220;He said nothing about it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t, of course,&#8221; said the soldier.
&#8220;He&#8217;s that way. But he was wounded in the arm.
I helped him bind it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How bad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He wouldn&#8217;t let me look. He
said he would attend to it when he got back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s taken a wireless in his pocket and
crept across No Man&#8217;s Land to find out what the
enemy is going to do. He&#8217;s wearing a dead Jerry&#8217;s
uniform&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain turned and brushed the back of his
hand across his eyes and a low sound between a sob
and a whispered cheer went up from the gathered
remnant as they rendered homage to their comrade.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For three days the messages came floating in,
telling vital secrets that were of vast strategic value.
Then the messages ceased, and the anxious officers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
and comrades looked in vain for word. Two more
days passed&mdash;three&mdash;and still no sign that showed
that he was alive, and the word went forth &#8220;Missing!&#8221;
and &#8220;Missing&#8221; he was proclaimed in the
newspapers at home.
</p>
<p>That night there was a lull in the sector where
Cameron&#8217;s company was located. No one could
guess what was going on across the wide dark space
called No Man&#8217;s Land. The captain sent anxious
messages to other officers, and the men at the listening
posts had no clue to give. It was raining and
a chill bias sleet that cut like knives was driving
from the northeast. Water trickled into the dugouts,
and sopped through the trenches, and the men
shuddered their way along dark passages and
waited. Only scattered artillery fire lit up the
heavens here and there. It was a night when all
hell seemed let loose to have its way with earth.
The watch paced back and forth and prayed or
cursed, and counted the minutes till his watch would
be up. Across the blackness of No Man&#8217;s Land
pock-marked with great shell craters, there raged
a tempest, and even a Hun would turn his back and
look the other way in such a storm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>Slowly, oh so slow that not even the earth would
know it was moving, there crept a dark creature
forth from the enemy line. A thing all of spirit
could not have gone more invisibly. Lying like a
stone as motionless for spaces uncountable, stirring
every muscle with a controlled movement that could
stop at any breath, lying under the very nose of
the guard without being seen for long minutes, and
gone when next he passed that way; slowly, painfully
gaining ground, with a track of blood where
the stones were cruel, and a holding of breath when
the fitful flare lights lit up the way; covered at
times by mud from nearby bursting shells; faint and
sick, but continuing to creep; chilled and sore and
stiff, blinded and bleeding and torn, shell holes and
stones and miring mud, slippery and sharp and
never ending, the long, long trail&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; came a sharp, clear voice through
the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pat! Come here! What is that?&#8221; whispered
the guard. &#8220;Now watch! I&#8217;m sure I saw it
move&mdash;&mdash;There! I&#8217;m going to it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better look out!&#8221; But he was off and back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
with something in his arms. Something in a ragged
blood-soaked German uniform.
</p>
<p>They turned a shaded flash light into the face
and looked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pat, it&#8217;s Cammie!&#8221; The guard was sobbing.
</p>
<p>At sound of the dear old name the inert mass
roused to action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Cap&mdash;they&#8217;re planning to slip away at
five in the morning. Tell him if he wants to catch
them he must do it <i>now</i>! Don&#8217;t mind me!
Go quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice died away and the head dropped back.
</p>
<p>With a last wistful look Pat was off to the captain,
but the guard gathered Cameron up in his
arms tenderly and nursed him like a baby, crooning
over him in the sleet and dark, till Pat came back
with a stretcher and some men who bore him to the
dressing station lying inert between them.
</p>
<p>While men worked over his silent form his message
was flashing to headquarters and back over
the lines to all the posts along that front. The time
had come for the big drive. In a short time a great
company of dark forms stole forth across No Man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
Land till they seemed like a wide dark sea creeping
on to engulf the enemy.
</p>
<p>Next morning the newspapers of the world set
forth in monstrous type the glorious victory and
how the Americans had stolen upon the enemy and
cut them off from the rest of their army, wiping out
a whole salient.
</p>
<p>But while the world was rejoicing, John Cameron
lay on his little hard stretcher in the tent and
barely breathed. He had not opened his eyes nor
spoken again.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
<h2>XX</h2>
</div>

<p>A nurse stepped up to the doctor&#8217;s desk:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A new girl is here ready for duty. Is there
any special place you want her put?&#8221; she asked in
a low tone.
</p>
<p>The doctor looked up with a frown:
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those half-trained Americans, I suppose?&#8221;
he growled. &#8220;Well, every little helps. I&#8217;d
give a good deal for half a dozen fully trained nurses
just now. Suppose you send her to relieve Miss
Jennings. She can&#8217;t do any harm to number
twenty-nine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any hope for him?&#8221; the nurse
asked, a shade of sadness in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not!&#8221; said the doctor shortly. &#8220;He
won&#8217;t take any interest in living, that&#8217;s the trouble.
He isn&#8217;t dying of his wounds. Something is troubling
him. But it&#8217;s no use trying to find out what.
He shuts up like a clam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The new nurse flushed outside the door as she
heard herself discussed and shut her firm little lips
in a determined way as she followed the head nurse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
down the long rows of cots to an alcove at the end
where a screen shut the patient from view.
</p>
<p>Miss Jennings, a plain girl with tired eyes, gave
a few directions and she was left with her patient.
She turned toward the cot and stopped with a soft
gasp of recognition, her face growing white and set
as she took in the dear familiar outline of the fine
young face before her. Every word she had heard
outside the doctor&#8217;s office rang distinctly in her ears.
He was dying. He did not want to live. With
another gasp that was like a sob she slipped to her
knees beside the cot, forgetful of her duties, of the
ward outside, or the possible return of the nurses,
forgetful of everything but that he was there, her
hero of the years!
</p>
<p>She reached for one of his hands, the one that
was not bandaged, and she laid her soft cheek
against it, and held her breath to listen. Perhaps
even now behind that quiet face the spirit had departed
beyond her grasp.
</p>
<p>There was no flutter of the eyelids even. She
could not see that he still breathed, although his
hand was not cold, and his face when she touched it
still seemed human. She drew closer in an agony
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
of fear, and laid her lips against his cheek, and then
her face softly, with one hand about his other cheek.
Her lips were close to his ear now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; she whispered softly, &#8220;John! My
dear knight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a quiver of the eyelids now, a faint
hesitating sigh. She touched her lips to his and
spoke his name again. A faint smile flickered over
his features as if he were seeing other worlds of
beauty that had no connection here. But still she
continued to press her face against his cheek and
whisper his name.
</p>
<p>At last he opened his eyes, with a bewildered,
wondering gaze and saw her. The old dear smile
broke forth:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth! You here? Is this&mdash;heaven?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; she whispered softly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
earth, and the war is over! I&#8217;ve come to help you
get well and take you home! It&#8217;s really you and
you&#8217;re not &#8216;Missing&#8217; any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then without any excuse at all she laid her lips
on his forehead and kissed him. She had read her
permit in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>His well arm stole out and pressed her to him
hungrily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;really you and you don&#8217;t belong to anybody
else?&#8221; he asked, anxiously searching her face
for his answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John! I never did belong to anybody else
but you. All my life ever since I was a little girl
I&#8217;ve thought you were wonderful! Didn&#8217;t you
know that? Didn&#8217;t you see down at camp? I&#8217;m
sure it was written all over my face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hand crept up and pressed her face close
against his:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling!&#8221; he breathed, &#8220;<i>my</i> darling!
The most wonderful girl in the world!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the doctor and nurse pushed back the
screen and entered the little alcove the new nurse
sat demurely at the foot of the cot, but a little while
later the voice of the patient rang out joyously:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor, how soon can I get out of this. I think
I&#8217;ve stayed here about long enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wondering doctor touched his patient&#8217;s
forehead, looked at him keenly, felt his pulse with
practised finger, and replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking you&#8217;d get to this spot pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
soon. Some beef tea, nurse, and make it good and
strong. We&#8217;ve got to get this fellow on his feet
pretty quick for I can see he&#8217;s about done lying
in bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the wounds came in for attention, and
Ruth stood bravely and watched, quivering in her
heart over the sight, yet never flinching in her outward
calm.
</p>
<p>When the dressing of the wounds was over the
doctor stood back and surveyed his patient:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in pretty good shape now, and if
you keep on you can leave here in about a week.
Thank fortune there isn&#8217;t any more front to go back
to! But now, if you don&#8217;t mind I&#8217;d like to know
what&#8217;s made this marvellous change in you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The light broke out on Cameron&#8217;s face anew.
He looked at the doctor smiling, and then he looked
at Ruth, and reached out his hand to get hers:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&mdash;we&mdash;Miss Macdonald&#8217;s
from my home town and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the doctor looking quizzically from
one happy face to the other, &#8220;but hasn&#8217;t she always
been from your home town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron twinkled with his old Irish grin:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;but, you see, she
hasn&#8217;t always been here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the doctor again looking quizzically
into the sweet face of the girl, and doing reverence
to her pure beauty with his gaze. &#8220;I congratulate
you, corporal,&#8221; he said, and then turning to
Ruth he said earnestly: &#8220;And you, too, Madame.
He is a man if there ever was one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the quiet evening when the wards were put to
sleep and Ruth sat beside his cot with her hand
softly in his, Cameron opened his eyes from the nap
he was supposed to be taking and looked at her
with his bright smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t told you the news,&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;I have found God. I found Him out on the battlefield
and He is great! It&#8217;s all true! But you have
to search for Him with <i>all</i> your heart, and not let
any little old hate or anything else hinder you, or
